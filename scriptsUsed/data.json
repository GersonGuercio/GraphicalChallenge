don't fall when I try to stand\nI lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt\nBut I make these high heels work\nI've told you time and time again\nI'm not as think as you drunk I am\nAnd we all fell down\nWhen the sun came up\nI think we've had enough\n\nAlright, alright, it's a helluva feeling though\nIt's a helluva feeling though\nAlright, alright, it's a helluva feeling though\nIt's a helluva
