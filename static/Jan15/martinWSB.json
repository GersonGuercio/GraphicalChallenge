{"body":"He took money from his own company to support trades in his hedge fund. Illegal? Almost certainly, but it's still very different than a Ponzi scheme. In a Ponzi scheme you use the money from new investors to directly pay the older investor, it does not involve actually trading or doing whatever business you tell the investors you are doing.\n\n For example, Madoff reported he made trades that never actually happened, he \"created\" money/returns that never actually existed by lying to investors. Compare this to what Shkreli did. He took money he was not supposed to use for trading and used it for trading and actually made money in the process. Like I said, it was probably illegal, but both how it happened and the end result of both instances were extremely different.","created_utc":"1500604099","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}
{"body":"Essentially, the allegations are that he stole both cash and shares worth millions of dollars from Retrophin, disguising them in some cases as consulting arrangements, in order to give shares to a small group of insiders, pay off creditors and his former MSMB investors (some of whom were complaining to the S.E.C.), and settle other lawsuits. He made horrible bets with MSMB shorting stocks, couldn't cover on Orexigen, and became insolvent, so he just went to found a new company to raise new funds (to cover the old losses). He said he would be exiting MSMB (after lying about doubling investors money, not losing everyone's money), and investors could cash out or convert to shares of Retrophin (which he never delivered on). He attempted to make people whole by using it as his personal banking service to cover his losses.  \n\n\nAccording to an indictment, instead of telling investors that he had lost their money, on September 10, 2012, he sent an e-mail claiming he had “just about doubled their money net of fees,”—previously having told one investor that MSMB had $35 million in its coffers when actually only $700 remained. He offered the investors a choice of cash or shares in Retrophin, where, he said, he was now going to focus his time. A firm which sued him over an unpaid bill wrote in its lawsuit (which was eventually settled), “At bottom, Retrophin is simply Shkreli’s alter ego, formed to defraud his bona fide creditors.”\n\nIn late 2012, Shkreli took Retrophin public through what’s known as a “reverse merger,” in which you merge a new business into an existing publicly traded shell, thereby getting stock that you can sell to investors. Such deals are so notoriously sleazy that the S.E.C. has issued a bulletin warning investors to stay away from them.\n\n","created_utc":"1501350989","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

Reasonable discussion about Shkreli turned into sarcastic YOLOs and mindless admiration of the guy. \n\nAfter the Shkreli drama blew over with the media, some douche kept bragging about how he wrote puts during the downfall of the SPY and turned a few hundred bucks into like 60k. Someone here, probably the douche, linked it to /r/pics or /r/all or one of those shit-reddits that has a hundreds of thousands of subscribers. So that brought a lot of attention and traffic here.  \n\nSince then, WSB has been mentioned on various twitter handles, marketwatch, etc. \n\nBasically, a bunch of fuckall idiots came here and ruined the vibe by trying to blend in via shitposts that aren't humorous or relevant.

{"body":"I don't get why Shkreli beats around the bush. He has profited off raising the price of the drug passing that cost off either directly to the consumer who need it or indirectly through healthcare which leads to rising premiums for everyone, negatively influencing more lives but to a lesser degree.\n\nWhile he does provide the drug for those who don't have healthcare, that prerequisite does create a dilemma of choosing between the lifesaving drug or potentially lifesaving healthcare for a specific subset of individuals.\n\nShkreli needs to own up to what he does instead of hiding behind \"it's just a tiny percent\". Those are peoples lives, man.\n\nI say this as an electrical engineer who decided to go into defense. Literally profiting off the ability to work on multi-hundred million dollar flying death machines to kill bad guys.\n\nPercentages are a psychological cog for those who don't want to deal with details of system they are working with.

{"body":"You don't know anything about the situation but let me guess, whatever it was he didn't do it right? \n\nPeople on this sub tend to have an extremely perverse base of knowledge on what he actually did, because they only watch his stupid videos, where big shocker there, he's not exactly an honest and Lincoln and tends to be grandiose about anything he did. You just can't take a con mans word as scripture. That's what a cult is. I'm all for memeing away, but this sub seems serious in its idiocy when it comes to shkreli. \n\nEssentially, the allegations are that he stole both cash and shares worth millions of dollars from Retrophin, disguising them in some cases as consulting arrangements, in order to give shares to a small group of insiders, pay off creditors and his former MSMB investors (some of whom were complaining to the S.E.C.), and settle other lawsuits. He made horrible bets with MSMB shorting stocks, couldn't cover on Orexigen, and became insolvent, so he just went to found a new company to raise new funds (to cover the old losses). He said he would be exiting MSMB (after lying about doubling investors money, not losing everyone's money), and investors could cash out or convert to shares of Retrophin (which he never delivered on). He attempted to make people whole by using it as his personal banking service to cover his losses.  \n\n\nAccording to an indictment, instead of telling investors that he had lost their money, on September 10, 2012, he sent an e-mail claiming he had “just about doubled their money net of fees,”—previously having told one investor that MSMB had $35 million in its coffers when actually only $700 remained. He offered the investors a choice of cash or shares in Retrophin, where, he said, he was now going to focus his time. A firm which sued him over an unpaid bill wrote in its lawsuit (which was eventually settled), “At bottom, Retrophin is simply Shkreli’s alter ego, formed to defraud his bona fide creditors.”\n\nIn late 2012, Shkreli took Retrophin public through what’s known as a “reverse merger,” in which you merge a new business into an existing publicly traded shell, thereby getting stock that you can sell to investors. Such deals are so notoriously sleazy that the S.E.C. has issued a bulletin warning investors to stay away from them.\n\n\n\n ","created_utc":"1499707448","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

It was actually linked to r/investing as \"when investing becomes gambling.\" There was this whole ordeal of him supposedly killing himself, and his \"mom\" coming on Reddit to talk about his situation. He then returned as fscomeau with his website and stuff, rinse and repeat.\n\nHe ended up getting banned and ended up in some [drama Reddit sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3j8wdi/rwallstreetbets_bans_a_top_contributor_for_being/?) about some betting gig gone wrong and how he tried to pay out the winners with bitcoins, and they never got their money.\n\nThere was also u/hypnotwist. Young kid that had everybody fooled, allegedly pumping like 500k into NBG, then he [was made out](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3va8sl/serious_beware_of_emails_from_uhypnotwist/?) by u/theycallme1 I believe, but not before he had convinced people into pumping low liquidity penny stocks.\n\nAnd of course there was the actually rich kid with a [hot wife](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3sluzm/i_am_ublackdowneys_wife_ama_fuckers/?) (looks like pictures were removed, sorry), u/blackdowney. This was around the time Shkreli started getting attention. He offered to make an official WSB shirt to cover all his losses. If he had gotten enough orders he said his wife would show her hooters, but alas that never happened. Too many broke Robin Hood accounts to meet demand. Was a sick shirt too.\n\nEdit: fixed a name, some grammar. Added link(s)","created_utc":"1459624632","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

{"body":"Back when 3D printers were all over the news, I put 2.5K into Stratasys. At the time it was like 1/4 of my account. I now have $500 of Stratasys... I also was really big on oil for a long time, which was apparently a really bad idea for several years, but you can hardly tell by now! I didn't give a shit back then bc I wasn't an ape that daytraded his Roth IRA like I am now. I just let it sit around collecting dividends while I spend my time investing in my grades instead of my account.\n\nThe last few months, I've been hanging out here, and also got approved for options. I'm just about flat for those months, but I'm definitely getting better. I've had several big losses in: Pussied out of AMD for $400 loss. Bought the dip on GOOG, but didn't give myself enough time on the options and threw away $600. Those were kind of tough since the total account is only ~32K, but I keep about half the total value in Vanguard ETFs and only really gamble with a quarter of the account.\n\nIf I liquidate my dedicated options yolo account, I am up $175 on $5200 starting capital put in 1 month ago, even after this NVDA shit and miscalling MGM. I expect to end up a big once MGM turns it around, or I'm just a horrible degenerate gambler that doesn't know how to quit while he's ahead. Luckily, my work is switching to Vanguard and I won't be able to gamble with my retirement accounts anymore. It feels like someone is saying \"put those away before you hurt yourself\" or \"you'll shoot your eye out\". \n\nSo no, I don't have losses that big (anymore... kinda), but we'll see by March 17 if I'm just too stupid to realize how fucked I am. Either way, soon the vast majority of my money will be in the boring safe stuff, and I will continue to shitpost my minor victories in the tiny playpen I have given myself. Unless I become a trading god (which I will, since I have Shkreli, Su, and WSB on my side), the Vanguard account will be worth the same as all my other accounts combined in 4 years time, and Vanguard shit is already almost half my investments.\n\nAlso how the fuck did you manage to lose that much? I know people make retard jokes here a lot, but I thought those were just jokes. All-in GILD, MGM, and AMD now and you'll make it back in no time.\n\nThanks for reading this blog. I'm out of cash, so there was nothing better to do.","created_utc":"1487964851","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

{"body":"lol\n\nShkreli didn't do it for philanthropy.  That's post facto justification because he's getting shat on.  He did it because he could. Because it would happen anyways. \n\nHe's no warrior for social justice, righting the wrongs of the pharma industry through political statements via rapid price corrections.  \n\nHe did something he was allowed to do, to make money, and basically said \"if you've got a problem with it, then do something about it, otherwise someone else will do it anyways.\" which is true, but still, he didn't do it out of the goodness of his heart.\n\nIt's like putting out boxed lunches each day, with a sign that says free lunches, and everyone goes and gets a lunch when they get hungry at lunch time.  Then one day shkreli shows up and loads all of the lunches into a truck and sells them across the street. When confronted he says \"Well, you idiots didn't say one lunch per customer, and someone is eventually going to take more than their share.\"\n\nHe did it because he could, because it benefited him, and because nobody could stop him from doing it.

The question is, does that bother you?  \n\nDon't pretend he's some kind of prosocial philanthropist.  Most people who admire him here admire him BECAUSE he's an antisocial hedonist.

{"body":"There honestly isn't that much more to the full story. It started with Shkreli photoshopping himself into one of her pictures and setting it as his twitter pic (he also had some pics of her on his banner and some sappy quote about love). This was what prompted Duca to tweet @Jack (twitter CEO) and ask for him to do something. Shkreli replied once to that tweet, and then continued to tweet various shops that his fans sent him on his own feed (he didn't tag her in these). He also registered the domain [http://marrymelauren.com/](http://marrymelauren.com/) but has yet to do anything with it. \n\nIt's worth noting though that most of the calls for his suspension came just after Duca's first tweet, before Shkreli had tweeted any additional shops or registered the website. Also, he's obviously not actually in love with her. To me this situation is very different from the Milo one, because Milo was continually tweeting at Leslie Jones over the course of a couple days.

{"body":"\u0026gt;It was one of the greatest sales pitches the music industry has ever heard. In March 2014, Robert Diggs, better known as RZA, the producer and de facto leader of the Wu-Tang Clan, the iconic rap group, announced that the Clan would create only one copy of its next album, Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, and sell it to the highest bidder. “We’re about to put out a piece of art like nobody else has done in the history of music,” RZA told Forbes. “We’re making a single-sale collector’s item. This is like someone having the scepter of an Egyptian king.”\n\n\u0026gt;Initially, the Clan wanted to forbid the buyer from publicly releasing the album for 88 years, but over time decided to grant the buyer total freedom as long as the album wasn’t sold commercially. That meant the owner could listen to the record in a soundproof room, drive a pickup truck over it, or release it for free on the Internet. If the owner desired, he could be the only one who ever heard it. In an era where people are happy to stream music rather than actually possess it, Once Upon a Time in Shaolinoffered a chance to own something truly unique.\n\n\ntl;Dr there is only one copy and he can do literally anything with it except sell it for profit\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-martin-shkreli-wu-tang-clan-album/","created_utc":"1482510933","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

{"body":"I assume when you say stay up to date on stocks you mean up to date on the markets. If you want to follow specific stocks, then you just follow the news and SEC filings (sec.gov/edgar). That's pretty easy to be honest because most companies don't have all that much news constantly. Not to mention the fact that all news is interpreted differently by different people. \n\nFor following the *markets* then you should know that you can't just follow \"stocks\" and expect to understand what's going on. Interest rates, commodities, world affairs, and many other topics will overlap and influence the stock market. Spend a few days watching bloomberg television (free on their website) and try to understand some of the macro perspectives they talk about. Obviously they are a business with biases too so I'm not telling you to blindly accept their advice, just try to understand what they're talking about. They'll put lots of neat graphs up and some are legit and some are superfluous bullshit. That's up to you individually to determine what to do with your money, no one else can tell you because no one knows exactly what will happen in the future. You need to decide how and what risk you will take. I'm rambling. \n\nThe approach you should take from the start is to put each financial vehicle, like shares of a stock, into the context of the greater market. For example, SBUX has to work with coffee commodity prices. They have to sell their goods to a consumer market that has ups and downs, and is different between regions. They also have to deal with the very value of the currency their shares are traded in, USD. Basically, you need to understand the entire economic picture, little to big. Obviously some companies are less effected than others.\n\nGo read everything you can on investopedia and just soak it all up. \n\nedit: Another go to bit of advice is to go watch Martin Shkreli's financial videos on youtube. He's got a whole series basically centered on cash flow analysis that is quite good for understanding the type of questions you should be asking about these stocks.

Drug company doesn't want drugs to not be written b/c they aren't covered which annoys docs offices. So reps give specialty pharmacy information to send scripts to\n\tSpecialty pharma covers drug no matter what.

It was available for a list price as low as 45 cents a capsule until May 2014 when one of the firms — Lannett Co. — raised its price per pill to $5.10. Lannett’s competitors quickly followed with their own price increases, with most offering the drug for about $5 a capsule\n“What did they do, put cocaine inside it?” asked Ken Solar, who lives with his wife. Lannett executives have told shareholders that the U.S. Justice Department is investigating the company’s pricing practices. Most Medicare patients were shielded from the rise in ursodiol’s price rise until this year. Solar said his insurer, Coventry, which is owned by Aetna, changed the classification of ursodiol from a Tier 2 generic medicine, for which patients pay $9 for each prescription, to Tier 4, which includes mostly expensive specialty drugs. Under Solar’s plan, beneficiaries must pay 50% of a Tier 4 medicine’s price, shifting far more of the cost to the patient. Walt Cherniak, an Aetna spokesman, said, “We moved it to a higher tier because of the rising price of the drug.”\nhttp://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-medicare-drug-costs-20161123-story.html\n\n\nHopefully that makes sense as to why insurance costs and drug costs will be going up for patients in the future.

Dude is a scamming fuck.  Worse than Shkreli.\n\n\"\"The NAC thus found that FINRA staff had \"set forth insufficient evidence proving that [Tang's] transactions were manipulative.\"\n\nOn appeal, the National Adjudicatory Council reversed Mr. Brokaw's market manipulation finding by FINRA but did find Mr. Brokaw violated his ethical duty by not adequately questioning Mr. Tang's orders. Ultimately, Mr. Brokaw was fined $30,000 and his broker license was suspended for one year, until January 2015. Mr. Kevin Tang's transactions ultimately lacked sufficient evidence to prove they were manipulative. But the deal certainly doesn't pass the sniff test. *Damage control saves stock price We contend Mr. Tang's funds' recent purchases of La Jolla shares is damage-control. He is well aware that La Jolla was forced to drop its previous lead drug candidate after a lupus nephritis study bombed in 2009. The stock price bombed, too. The stock was delisted and moved to the OTC Bulletin Board on March 4, 2010. A transfusion in the form of a private stock offering the following May barely revived the company, followed by a 1-for-100 reverse stock split. It ultimately took a 1-for-50 reverse stock split in January 2014 for La Jolla to return to the NASDAQ. The chart below graphically shows what happened to La Jolla's stock after its 2009 drug candidate got shelved. The stock lost nearly 90 percent of its value, plunging to $0.26 per share.\"","created_utc":"1475465789","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

But a [clinical trial](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1507574#t=articleTop) involving patients who already had at least some heart damage found that the drug did not slow the progression of heart disease compared with a placebo. Some doctors say it would be better to treat patients before heart disease develops, but not many asymptomatic people are screened to see if they are infected.\n\nand the following from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benznidazole):\n\n\u0026gt; Benznidazole has a significant activity during the acute phase of the disease, with a therapeutical success rate up to 80%. Its curative capabilities during the chronic phase are, however, limited. Some studies have found parasitologic cure (a complete elimination of T. cruzi from the body) in pediatric and young patients during the early stage of the chronic phase, but overall failure rate in chronically infected individuals is typically above 80%.[1]\n\n\u0026gt; However, some studies indicate treatment with benznidazole in chronic patients, even if incapable of producing parasitologic cure, carries a significative reduction of occurrence of electrocardiographic changes and a delayed worsening of the clinical condition of the patient.[1]\n\n\u0026gt; Benznidazole has proven to be effective in the treatment of reactivated T. cruzi infections caused by immunosuppression, such as AIDS patients or those under immunosuppressive therapy related to organ transplants.[1]","created_utc":"1449997497","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

{"body":"Your first paragraph is my key. He can claim anything he wants. That doesn't make it true. Trump can claim global warming is Chinese hoax. If I have no evidence otherwise maybe that makes sense to a degree. But when I'm presented with contrary information that can be verified, or even if I believe the lies of a conman through a webcam and do not check on that, I'm a bit gullible. \n\nInvestigations into Turings claim of 60% \"RND\" showed much of that went to vague institutions. 98 million dollars of revenue for 1 million in manufacturing costs. 22 million  supposedly went to RND, but they went to donations to unnamed foundations. Investigations showed it was more about PR than RND. The \"research\" budget was actually used to \"research\" the next drug they would acquire and jack the price up on. \n\n\nParagraph 4 is just garbage. \n\nThree is on point besides shkreli not being the bad guy. This is related to 5. But Pharma doing dirty Tricks (I could in for days, shkrelis skeleton late doesn't even scratch the surface) does not remove any blame from shkreli. \n\nPoint 5... this is where you get me! This where shkreli is one of the biggest know douche bags around. Follow me here. \n\nWith the express approval pass, there is a bit of a loop hole where the intent was to encourage providing treatments for rare conditions, notably in areas of third world countries where there is a lack of attention, and the FDA awards basically an express lane certificate nearly halving the amount of time they would take to approve drugs (which itself is a whole deal where now efforts at FDA must be removed from useful drugs to ones that are basic combination therapies). This is worth billions to a company.  These can be bought and sold. Skirelli douche was planning on using the loophole for approving the treatment for Chagas' disease, basically something not needed at all, in order to get a certificate and sell it for possibly hundreds of millions. \n\nHe acquired Kalobios under shady pretenses, and then right away paid 2 million bucks for the rights to a Tx for chaggas disease. Roche long ago had donated the rights of the drug to the Brazilian government. It was widely available world wide, distributed by the CDC, however, never actually approved officially by America's FDA. Because of the amount of data available on the drug, so open for so long, they were hoping to not have to actually run any trials to be granted approval. You don't actually have to invent the drug to get the voucher, in hind sight, probably a large issue overlooked. So this douche again, was attempting to use loopholes in a system to obtain a voucher, intended to be given to those researching and developing drugs for rare and underdeveloped indications particularly in poor countries, in order to turn 2 mill into 400 million. Without doing any R\u0026amp;D. Shows how much he truly cared about that aspect. And this voucher, would likely be used to bring out a block buster drug, probably not novel or lifesaving, likely just a \"me too\",  a few months earlier to market, while at the same time, delaying another drug from coming onto market. \n","created_utc":"1498768499","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

The medication is often prescribed to people with HIV/AIDS, pregnant women, and babies. With the price increase, some of those patients received $16,000 co-pays for a single prescription.\n\nI would like to see a source on that $16k copay because Turing and Shkreli have insisted that when it's not covered adequately by insurance, then their patient assistance programs bring the cost to a very reasonable level.

{"body":"Martin Shkreli bought the patent to a 70 year old medicine. It had never been improved during that time.\n\nThere are approximately 1,000,000 people who suffer from HIV in the United States. 10,000 have AIDs. Less than 2000 will have to be treated for toxoplasmosis, an infectious disease, with Daraprim. It's not a lifelong treatment; it only takes a few weeks of Daraprim to remedy the infection.\n\nInsurance companies don't charge copays for treatment. If somebody is uninsured, Retrophin, (the company Martin Shkreli had been CEO of that raised the prices), will provide pills for free. They also do not sell for profit to the government. The only person paying any extra are the big insurance companies. The price has gone *down* for everybody else. If you Google, you will see you won't be able to find a single instance where somebody couldn't get Daraprim due to the fact they couldn't afford it.\n\nFurthermore, the cost of these new treatments, yearly, will be less than 0.0004% the total amount insurance companies pay out every year.\n\nRetrophin puts 65% of all profits into research and development. Far more than the industry standard of 15%; 5x as much, actually. You know what else is an industry standard? Raising drug prices. Since those allegations were made, drug prices have been raised more than 1000 times on various drugs. Too bad you never hear about it.\n\nIn short, Martin Shkreli got handpicked by the media as a scapegoat for the pharmaceutical industry. He didn't do anything wrong.\n\nAs far as hedge funds go: he probably was fraudulent this time around. However, I don't see anybody freaking out at the dozens of money managers indicted and convicted weekly of embezzlement or other related fraud charges. He may have solicited some stock from Retrophin to investors, we just don't know yet. We'll have to see what the court decides.\n\nA big flaw with the case is that in a Ponzi scheme, people lose money. In this case, nobody lost any money. Also, the people the SEC are saying he defrauded never made allegations or attempted to sue him. Like I said, we'll have to wait and see.","created_utc":"1498535015","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

That'll show you his thought process so you can key in on what's important and what isn't.","created_utc":"1449276130","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}
{"body":"This book is available for entirely free for everyone. This is my gift to you and my way of saying \"thank you\" to all of you.\n\nThis whole adventure has been exceptional and I wanted to take the time to put it in writing. In it, you will find the entire story, starting with my very first post on WSB. The book also contains unreleased stories, receipts, unfinished posts and much more. It also discusses my excellent discussion with Martin Shkreli as well as some of the media fallout.\n\nFor those of you who still don't get it - yes, I was indeed posting the exact inverses of my trades on WSB. I have been doing that for quite a while and those of you who guessed it have made a good fortune from it. The book explains how I came to make this decision as well.\n\nAll of that for absolutely free, of course. \n\nTo all of you who are seriously angry at me: I'm sorry. My goal has always been to entertain people and have fun. I thought I made it pretty obvious, pretty early that I was indeed inversing myself all along. Yes, I was indeed long on Apple during the earnings and made quite a bit of money. I mean, I wasn't even subtle about it. \"Why Alphabet is not an Alpha Bet\" I mean, come on.\n\nBut if you are seriously angry at me for whatever reason, then I don't want that to remain. I will help you gain back the money you lost on Apple for absolutely free. No, it's not a system/whatever, but from now on, I will no longer post the inverses of my trades.\n\nWhy am I doing this now? Because I think the troll has lasted long enough. I love trolling, it's part of who I am (again the book explains this a fair bit), but it's time for me to move on and stop trolling. Or troll just a little bit :). I don't want to be seen just as a troll and there are things I want to accomplish in this life.\n\nOnce again, thank you for the phenomenal adventure,\nFSC","created_utc":"1487263563","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

{"body":"Keep a portfolio of dank memes and #YOLO bets near a framed portrait of Shkreli on your desk at all times. People will stop to network with YOU.\n\nBut, in all seriousness, that's a broad question.  All depends on what you want to do! It especially helps if you are already social.\n\nI will warn though, especially for people that are naturally social, that there is a difference in networking between talking AT people and talking with people. Typically, if you're at an event (local CFA societies can be good for this, but so can your own company mixers/happy hours/external betworking events/meetups) you will meet many people that could be very high up and potential future connections/employers. The key to networking there is to be fluid, but also focus on them and have them talk as much as possible.\n\nCommon mistake I see at events like this is someone trying to prove their value and worth over the course of a conversation. Don't try to prove anything or be the smartest person in the room. Being intimadeted can be a good thing, as it's not a time to sell yourself. You should do 20% of the talking/asking questions to get them to open up. Relate or something to things they say and just guide the conversation around their life, what they do, how they got there. Be genuinely interested, as they are typically people working jobs that YOU want to work, and people fucking love talking about themselves to someone that is actively listening. The only thing you really want to prove is that you have the capacity to listen and learn, at first at least.\n\nThat's what I've had work.\n\nOne tactic I've seen work is effectively cold calling/emailing the HR groups of firms you want to work for, or specific people you find on linkedin, asking for a 10-15 minute chat to just learn what they do. Aint easy, and be prepared for an abysmal (less than 10%) hit rate. But when it works, could be a game changer. That's assuming you have no current connections/leads to work with.\n\nAnyway, thats a rant. Hope it helps? No idea where you're at in life experience/career wise, but I could give more specific examples too.","created_utc":"1503615999","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

For example in an IRA account where margin is not allowed you can sell naked puts if you have enough cash to back it up.  They won't let you sell naked calls however(because the losses would be unlimited).\n\nAssuming you're on margin and the amount of the underlying falls way below your cash amount than the broker can close the position at a loss(negative loss).

I've never read a story that didn't include the fact that he raised the price of a drug \u0026amp; is in court (on completely separate charges). Shkreli is perfectly content with taking on the villain persona; every headline about him goes one step further to expose the malpractice of pharmaceutical giants around the world. The best part is that he's actually a brilliant guy; every time he's interviewed the hosts have their argument dismantled and try to change the subject to his politicized \"securities fraud\" case.

As are all the investigations. \n\nPeople are such hive minded sheep. Or am I the contrarian sheep now?  Let's find out kids! \n\n\nThe [House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform prepared a memo](https://democrats-oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/Memo%20on%20Turing%20Documents.pdf) of Turing Pharmacuetical's decisioning for raising the price of the drug containing the companies internal communication. According to one email from September of 2015, only around 23% of the drug is being \"given away,\" through Medicaid. I'm not aware of the number of participants through the PaP. Are you? \n\n\u0026gt;He's developing a better drug.\n\n* He resigned as CEO and no longer works for Turing, so he isn't developing anything. \n* What proof is there that profits are being reinvested into R\u0026amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;D?\n* Martin Shkreli hired multiple PR firms that advise he claim that profits would be reinvested in R\u0026amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;D, because of the pushback the company faced. \n\n\u0026gt;On October 8, 2015, an outside consultant sent an email to a member of Turing’s Board\nof Directors, writing: **“As I mentioned this morning, here is what I think Turing should\ndo going forward. … As early as next week, the Board should remove Martin as CEO. …\nthe price drop has to be significant and tied to something. … this cannot be seen as\nsomething that appears to be as arbitrary as the price hike in the first place.”**34\n• The same consultant continued: “What I’d be looking for is something along the lines of\nTuring lowers the price by xx% and announces a package of assistance programs for\npatients that guarantees no patient will be denied access nor will they pay anymore. …\nThis will force reporters to focus on the byzantine nature of drug pricing and health care\nand ensure the patient message gets out. … **specifically tie profits from Daraprim to the\nresearch and development of a new and more effective treatment for Daraprim patients.\n… This can set you up also for more long term reputation rehabilitation by forcing a\nfocus on Turing as a research and development company—not a pharma hedge fund\nhybrid.”** The board member forwarded the email to Nancy Retzlaff, Chief Commercial\nOfficer, and Ed Painter, the Head of Investor Relations at Turing, the same day.35\n\nDr. Rima McLeod was one of the few Dr.'s that was actually publically supportive of Turing's actions, according to the memo. But, even she expressed concern about the smoke and mirrors of Turings actions. Including the PaP and incredibly high copays. \n\n\u0026gt;On October 9, 2015, Dr. McLeod sent an email to Nancy Retzlaff, Turing’s Chief\nCommercial Officer, and Dr. Eliseo Salinas, the President of Research and Development,\nwriting: “From the news media I see you are also preparing for a congressional\ninvestigation by today which is asking you the same things I asked you re payer mix and\ncosts and expenses. **And what resources there really are left for toxoplasmosis research.**\nNot other diseases. **And how much is paying off the venture capital debt and building a\ndifferent pipeline. What does it really cost a company to [p]rovide this medicine so it\nhelps people with all the extra distribution issues when the market is closed?”** She\nconcluded: **“I am concerned about patients and that Walgreens continue to state they are\ngoing to clear for insurance first which means that patients wait for medicines, and that is\nunacceptable.”** Dr. McLeod sent another email later that day, writing: **“This sounds like\nsmoke and mirrors when someone’s sight and life are threatened and is not acceptable. …\nThere really cannot be delays. People will really be hurt lifelong. You have a monopoly\non safe reliable medicine right now and it truly matters for people’s lives.”**45 \n\n\u0026gt;On December 8, 2015, Dr. McLeod sent an email to Ms. Retzlaff and Eliseo Salinas,\nTuring’s President of Research and Development. She wrote: “I understand I know\nnothing of what makes Turing solvent and able to do research and of course I value that a\nlot too. … **However, Martin [Shkreli] did say that he had to maximize profit for investors\nand that was why price is high. He did not say it was for research primarily that it was a\nhigh price.** He called that the ‘dirty secret’ of pharma.”4\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-f6rQ1PZGw\n\nhttp://www.marketwatch.com/story/1bn-here-we-come-martin-shkreli-told-turing-board-as-daraprim-buy-got-closer-2016-02-03\n\nhttp://hivclinician.org/pyrimethamine/\n\nInvestigations into Turings claim of 60% \"RND\" showed much of that went to vague institutions. 98 million dollars of revenue for 1 million in manufacturing costs. 22 million  supposedly went to RND, but they went to donations to unnamed foundations.

{"body":"I've been debating with myself over the last few weeks whether or not I should write this letter. Obviously, I outvoted myself and wrote it. I concluded I absolutely had to tell you that Martin Shkreli's gang (motto: “Replace intellectual integrity with flighty sloganeering”) is as directionless as directionless can be. For practical reasons, I have to confine my discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which I have something new to say. Martin has separate, oftentimes antipodal, interests from ours. For instance, he's intererested in fortifying a social correctness that restricts experience and defines success with narrow boundaries. In contrast, my interests—and perhaps yours as well—include telling people that Martin has been going around claiming that everything will be hunky-dory if we let him brand me as craven. When challenged about the veracity of that message, Martin attributed its contradictions of the truth to “poetic license”. That means “lying”.\n\nAll of the claims I've read regarding the benefits of Martin's insinuations have been completely premature. That is, they always seem to be based on an inadequate exploration of these insinuations, their history, and their possible meanings. I avouch it is therefore high time we deal stiffly with uppity oafs who muster enough force to funnel significant amounts of money to hopeless fugitives. Let me start the ball rolling with the observation that it has been brought to my attention that Martin is a hideous mobster trying to get attention for himself by being more semi-intelligible than the next hideous mobster. While this is true, engaging Martin in intelligent debate is far from easy. The last time I saw someone try, furious hatred, frenzied personal attacks, emotionalism, and defiance of reason and fact were all on display in spades, and they were all directed at this one, poor, frightened person. I wish Martin would more calmly accept the fact that I'm by no means the first person to expose him as a disaffected flibbertigibbet. However, it's still somewhat rare for anyone to state publicly that Martin's klatch of uncouth ivory-tower academics has found a rallying cry for its upcoming battle against our most treasured liberties. That rallying cry is, “Chekism is the key to world peace!” It's quotes like that that make me realize that from secret-handshake societies meeting at “the usual place” to back-door admissions committees, Martin's pals have always found a way to procure explosive devices, gasoline, and detonators for use in an upcoming campaign of terror.\n\nI've tried explaining to Martin's slaveys that Martin's sentiments are sadistic, poisonous to young minds, and disrespectful to Western values and achievements. Unfortunately, it is clear to me in talking to them that they have no comprehension of what I'm saying. I might as well be talking to creatures from Mars. In fact, I'd bet Martians would be more likely to discern that brown-nosing jackanapes commonly succumb to Martin's distortions, deceptions, and delusions. I do not. Rather, I take pride in confronting and rejecting all manifestations of Titoism.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Martin maintains that he does the things he does “for the children”. This is complete—or at least, incomplete—baloney. For instance, Martin fails to mention that in a tacit concession of defeat, he is now openly calling for the abridgment of various freedoms to accomplish coercively what his pernicious, passive-aggressive bruta fulmina have failed at. He keeps trying to promote his boisterous substitute for morality, which defines as iscariotic any attempt to keep our courage up. And if we don't remain eternally vigilant, he will honestly succeed. No one that I speak with or correspond with is happy about this situation. Of course, I don't speak or correspond with two-faced lummoxes, Martin's yes-men, or anyone else who fails to realize that when I was a child my clergyman told me, “There are other strains of Satanism active today, and the siren calls of those movements may mesmerize virulent cheapjacks whose deplorable behavior blinds them to historical lessons.” If you think about it you'll see his point.\n\nWhy is Martin forcing us to bow down low before the most meretricious potlickers you'll ever see? He says he's doing it for some worthy cause. In reality, Martin is doing it because the biggest difference between me and Martin is that Martin wants to endow deconstructionism with a false legitimacy. I, on the other hand, want to cast a ray of light on his scary shell games. Let me close by remarking that if I have succeeded, as I hope and believe I have, in presenting such a combination of facts and arguments as has demonstrated the propriety of explaining a few facets of this confusing world around us, I shall regard it as evidence complete that these lines have been judiciously penned.","created_utc":"1461986141","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

{"body":"And how wrong it is. That tends to happen when you only get your information from shkreli and his little web cam videos. He has not reason to be biased, right?

He made horrible bets with MSMB shorting stocks, couldn't cover on Orexigen, and became insolvent, so he just went to found a new company to raise new funds (to cover the old losses). He said he would be exiting MSMB (after lying about doubling investors money, not losing everyone's money), and investors could cash out or convert to shares of Retrophin (which he never delivered on). He attempted to make people whole by using it as his personal banking service to cover his losses.  \n\n\nAccording to an indictment, instead of telling investors that he had lost their money, on September 10, 2012, he sent an e-mail claiming he had “just about doubled their money net of fees,”—previously having told one investor that MSMB had $35 million in its coffers when actually only $700 remained. He offered the investors a choice of cash or shares in Retrophin, where, he said, he was now going to focus his time. A firm which sued him over an unpaid bill wrote in its lawsuit (which was eventually settled), “At bottom, Retrophin is simply Shkreli’s alter ego, formed to defraud his bona fide creditors.”\n","created_utc":"1499058959","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

Retrophin’s board ousted Mr. Shkreli as CEO in 2014.\n\nMr. Shkreli had pleaded not guilty to seven counts of securities fraud and conspiracy. Mr. Greebel had pleaded not guilty to one count of wire-fraud conspiracy.\n\nOn Friday, Brooklyn federal prosecutors added a new securities fraud conspiracy charge against both men related to Mr. Shkreli’s alleged failure to disclose to the Securities and Exchange Commission his control over certain shares of Retrophin. Mr. Greebel had served as outside counsel to Retrophin.\n\nBenjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Mr. Shkreli, said in a statement: “There is nothing in the new indictment that impacts in any way on the flawed theory of the case as applied to Mr. Shkreli.”\n\nRELATED\n\nProsecutors Say More Charges Against Martin Shkreli Likely\nLawyer Charged With Fraud in Martin Shkreli Case Resigns From Firm\nReed Brodsky, a lawyer for Mr. Greebel, declined to comment.\n\nMr. Shkreli gained notoriety during his time as CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals AG, when he raised by more than 50-fold the price of a drug that treats a potentially deadly parasitic infection. He resigned as CEO of Turing shortly after his arrest.\n\n\nThe criminal charges against Mr. Shkreli have nothing to do with his time at Turing, although Mr. Shkreli has said in a previous interview with The Wall Street Journal that he believed had been targeted by authorities partly because of the drug-price increase.\n\nA court hearing in the case is scheduled for Monday.","created_utc":"1465235706","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

{"body":"GILD is a big fucking whale with like 75% institutional ownership or something right now. It used to be way higher, we're talking like 95% back in 2014. \n\nRecently, the HCV business is shrinking and the big holders are selling off because they want to see growth instead - if you're a fund manager and you want to put some money in biotech so you can tout your shitty fund as \"diversified\" so that retiring baby boomer lemmings will buy it and pay you ridiculous fees for sitting on your ass, it's easier to go in on some AMGN/ABBV memes, those companies have positive growth and forward PEs aren't too scary to put your ~~dick~~ money in. \n\nMeanwhile, GILD is sitting on like $2B cash, and investors are yelling at the management for not doing anything with it (except some share buybacks) while the stock price dips. So now the 25% regular people holding GILD are shitting themselves because they don't know anything about running a company or how businesses work and they're bagholding because they bought way at the top at $120. They've been in the stock 2 years and haven't made a dime, anyone without a solid thesis for GILD is trying to cut their losses because they think the stock is going to fall more. \n\nNobody is pulling their heads out their ass to see that the HIV business alone puts the stock price at $70-80 depending on how bad your math is. Instead they're blaming management for not spending the $2B cash the company is holding to buy hookers a.k.a. shitty pipeline acquisitions.  \n\nGILD has a current PE in like the 7-9 range, which is ridiculous for both a biotech and a blue chip that pays a fucking 2.5% dividend. Management isn't retarded, they're not buying shares to prop up the price (because that's obviously not working, yet the buybacks continue). They're buying it back because they think it's cheap. \n\nThe major potential risk, as Shkreli mentioned, is the HIV patent cliff. We're starting to see TDF generics in Europe real soon and the same is gonna happen in the US over the next few years. There's a move to transition these patients to TAF drugs, which were launched in 2015/2016, so the patents on those will last for a while. The issue is if this transition goes poorly GILD could lose market share/profit margin to generics and also to those Pfizer/GSK cucks. \n\nDisclosure: I'm bagholding, and plan to increase my position in the next 72 hours.

{"body":"The commonly agreed upon estimate is that about 300,000 people in the US has Chagas, and most of those are immigrants from Latin America who contracted it outside the US. \n\nIt seems like there is increased fear of disease vectors in the Southern US (Texas in particular). The review\n\nGarcia MN, Woc-Colburn L, Aguilar D,\nHotez PJ, Murray KO (2015) Historical Perspectives\non the Epidemiology of Human Chagas Disease in\nTexas and Recommendations for Enhanced\nUnderstanding of Clinical Chagas Disease in the\nSouthern United States. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 9(11):\ne0003981. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0003981\n\nnotes in particular that hunters and \"impoverished residents\nliving in substandard housing infested by triatomines\" are at-risk groups. There are very few confirmed cases of Chagas contracted in the US, but we also have basically no testing and according to the same review article:\n\n\u0026gt; It has been documented that physician awareness of this important infectious\ndisease is low; however, what is particularly alarming is that only 11% of positive donors or\ntheir physicians seek treatment for disease from the CDC [16]. This finding was supported by\nour study, where only 25% of positive donors received additional follow-up care for their disease. Anecdotally, several of our study participants reported that their physicians told them they were “false positives” and that it was “impossible” for them to be infected.\n\nThe \"disproportionately affects poor and marginalized populations\" seems to be easily met, and there also looks to be evidence of no significant market in the US at least.\n\nOne fear I have regarding eligibility for the priority voucher program is whether they will apply for treatment of just acute Chagas or for chronic Chagas. Pretty much all of the 300,000 are at the chronic stage and at that point Benznidazole is of limited use. On the other hand there are indications of severe underreporting of acute cases in the US, but with less than a dozen confirmed cases in 60 years FDA approval might be harder and demonstrating anything statistically significant about a population in the single digits is impossible.\n\nAccording to the NYT article \"Mr. Shkreli estimated that 3,000 to 7,000 people would require treatment for acute infection each year in the United States.\" which seems crazy given that we have 7 confirmed cases since 1955. Even if it's way underdiagnosed at the moment, 3000 diagnosed cases a year seems unrealistic. Maybe he meant chronic infection.\n\nThe more I look into it the more convinced I get that KBIO will be awarded a voucher and maybe that they can even make some money on Benznidazole. If I can get a decent entry point early next week I will definitely load up on some KBIO for a yolo bet. It's uncertain, but in expectation it seems like a good bet. Let's just hope that no one influential actually wants to make a point about ethical practices in pharma (Daraprim is probably a simpler and more compelling story so I bet politicians will keep their focus on that rather than a semi-abuse of an obscure voucher system).\n\nEDIT: Also good job noticing this opportunity before the rest of us.","created_utc":"1449980342","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

Shkreli never worked on any research related to drugs or medicine despite him trying his hardest to make it appear so.\n\nSure, he has some understanding of the field, and he does read about clinical trials to make decisions about which drugs to invest in, but he's not responsible for any of the actual research.","created_utc":"1508182405","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}
{"body":"\"In perhaps the most breathtaking example of how he focused his extreme IQ on the task, he cold-called a medical geneticist named Susan Hayflick, who worked on the other side of the country at Oregon Health \u0026amp; Science University, in Portland. Hayflick was used to toiling in deep obscurity. But Shkreli had somehow dug up her 25 years of research into a rare and terrible disease called PKAN, related to mutations in the PanK-II gene that cause involuntary muscle spasms. PKAN's symptoms arrive slowly but relentlessly, until the patient can no longer walk, see or even swallow food. Heart-wrenchingly, most of its victims are children - and there are as many as 10,000 cases worldwide. With no known way to reverse PKAN's course, patients typically die within ten to 12 years.\n\nHayflick had successfully identified the gene behind PKAN, but come to a dead end when trying to find a cure. Shkreli called her because he'd thought of a molecular modification that might work - but he needed a phD researcher to test it. Hayflick was sceptical of the cocky young man on the line, who claimed to be a self-taught biologist and multimillionaire CEO. But she couldn't resist seeing if he was right.\n\nAnd - she could barely believe her own eyes - he was.\n\n\"Humbling,\" is how she later described the experience.\"\n\nSource: http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/martin-shkreli","created_utc":"1508194929","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

It's not as good as other memestocks like NVDA, or as good as some of my picks like SQ, PYPL, and MGM, but I blindly trusted his insight and it worked out as a glorious piece of WSB history.\n\nAnother major component of it is that Shkreli has literally done nothing wrong, but the entire mainstream press decided that it was time to shit on him for no reason. Rather than apologize or go into hiding, he took journalists head on through both serious discussions and well-executed trolling. There's a number of interviews and articles where Shkreli discusses how huge multinational pharma corps have been doing the same things repeatedly and somehow his tiny company became the name and face of corporate greed. He called out a lobbyist group and their sponsors in http://www.pharmaskeletons.com/ ... even though his drug hikes were to support research for other orphan drugs, which PhRMA also says is one of their priorities http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/361274-fight-erupts-over-tax-credit-for-orphan-disease-drugs.

{"body":"He's got a really inspiring story:\n\n\u0026gt;Shkreli was born in Coney Island Hospital, Brooklyn. He is the son of Albanian and Croatian immigrants who worked as janitors. He, his two sisters, and his brother grew up in a working class community in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. Shkreli was raised Catholic and attended Sunday school as a child.\n\n\u0026gt;Shkreli attended Hunter College High School. He dropped out before his senior year due to a lack of interest, but received the credits necessary for his diploma through a program that placed him in an internship at Wall Street hedge fund Cramer, Berkowitz and Company when he was 17. Sources differ on whether Shkreli graduated from Hunter or whether he received sufficient credits there but actually graduated from City-As-School High School.\n\n\u0026gt;Shkreli received a bachelor's degree in business administration from Baruch College in 2004. Shkreli told Vanity Fair that he developed an interest in chemistry when a family member suffered from treatment-resistant depression. In March 2015, Hunter College High School announced that Shkreli donated $1,000,000 to them.\n\n\u0026gt;During Shkreli's time at Cramer, Berkowitz and Company, he recommended short-selling a biotech stock, believing that the company's share price would drop. When it did so, Cramer's hedge fund profited. In 2003, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals was testing a weight‑loss drug, and Shkreli, then 19, predicted that the stock price would fall. Shkreli's prediction drew the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which investigated Shkreli's knowledge about the stock but found no wrongdoing on his part","created_utc":"1498500573","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

I can't tell if you're being wilfully obtuse or lack reading comprehension. \n\n\n\u0026gt;Think about this for a moment. Martin's wealth is directly correlated to how much he has raised the price of these drugs. \n\nSo to recap, you went from implying it was a hostage situation with the patient(wrong) to saying taxpayers will suffer(wrong again) to now trying to argue why it's wrong because other countries make it cheaper.\n\n\u0026gt;Daraprim was hiked from 13.50 to 750 per pill, that is 736.5 pure profit. At 75000 a course for 5000 individuals that is 375 mil. The drug costs 5 to 10 cents a dose in other countries.\n\nWe already know drugs are cheaper to manufacture - we don't need to look at other countries but when other countries with less regulations make generic pyrimethamine, they aren't making it reliably or to therapeutic purity but it's irrelevant again because the only ones footing the bill are big corporations.  Shkreli didn't simply raise it for personal wealth, that's why almost all the money from Daraprim went back into R\u0026amp;D for Turing unlike just about every other drug company that also price-hikes. And specifically, his drug pricing was on the lower end of such \"orphan drugs\" and has said he would have raised the price higher because as a CEO, he has a duty to maximize profits for shareholders or he gets the boot. If you disagree with drug prices then take it up with the government, not a random CEO trying to help a struggling company by taking every legal advantage on a competitive field and still being ethical about patient access to drugs. Shkreli has also said on TV that he backed Trump to push the FDA to regulate generics faster to combat this practice.\n\n\n\n","created_utc":"1493570921","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

Have you ever asked yourself, that if shrkreli and his ilk are making fat wads of cash, why you aren't investing in their companies and taking some of those Ill-gotten gains?\n\nIn reality, obviously, these companies don't make that much money.  The reason why the drug price was hiked was because the company had to pay off the inventor to buy the patent. This gives the chemists and such their much needed motive to discover more cures. On top of this, most of the drugs are given freely to those who prove they couldn't otherwise afford it, and the new obscene price is only paid by the insurance companies who can afford it. This essentially socializes the reward given to the drug inventors, while companies like shkreli's profit from the continued manufacture and dispersal. \n\nOnce again, if you think these companies are inflating these drug prices and pocketing the proceeds, go look at their sec filings and check out their earnings.

I was stupid when i started investing and believed that MJ penny stocks were the best things ever, because I started in March when that bubble was peaking. I made $3000 in a week with just $1000, got hooked and proceeded to lose $9000 in the next year. It taught me a super valuable lesson: you worked fucking hard for your money, stop gambling it on penny stocks and bullshit u have no idea about because its going to rape you 99% of the time and leave u penniless. Invest in real things, in companies that have value. You use amazon? Great ! Thats a good company. You use netflix and all your friends do do? Great, its also a great company. Does Anavex make any money or have any products that are out in market yet? No? Then dont touch it. Wait for shitty bad days and dips in good comapanies and use that as a entry point. \n\nYou want a good stock? TEVA . The world needs generic drugs and its the largest maker in the world by farrrrr after it bought the generic wing of actavis. Drug pricing scandals are being thrown around left and right since Shkreli and Valeant, so generic makers are the clear winners in this scenario. Stop buying shit.

I was in a lot of bands in high school and college. I love rap, obviously. I think I could express myself through it. There’s never been an [incredibly wealthy] rapper. All these guys rap about is money and I have a lot to say. \n\nI can't fucking wait for the Shkreli rap album. That shit is definitely going to be golden. He should call it 5,000%.\n\n\u0026gt; I’m testing it out, but in no means or way saying that I can do it. Just kind-of test it out to see if it goes well. It could be total shit. It could be great. Who knows? Probably it’s not going to be good. Very few people make it. How many people want to rap? Everyone. How many people can rap? Very limited quantities. I’m even talking to some ghost writers. If Drake can do it, I can do it. [Laughs]\n\nOkay whatever producers Shkreli comes to better humour him and tell him he is the best.

{"body":"\u0026gt;Drugs in general cost a lot of money and are supposed to fund further research\n\nThat's not how any of this works traditionally. Drugs are expensive in order to _recoup_ development costs and for profit. In this model, you reward successful researchers.\n\nDrugs aren't a kickstarter, you don't pay in hoping that future drugs _might_ work. In that model, you gamble on whether you think these researchers will be of any use (most likely not because they have zero proven products). Kickstarters are for suckers, the smart consumer only pays AFTER something successful is developed.\n\nIdeally, capitalism and the patent system is supposed to reward inventors and producers. Shkreli exploited the market and gave nothing back to society because he had no role in the creation of pyrimethamine, just his very clever de facto monopoly of it. He's the middleman, extracting profit from the consumer. (So while kickstarters are for suckers, due to the way healthcare is delivered, we are all suckers)\n\n\u0026gt;If a person does not have insurance(which is now mandatory by law due to the Affordable Care Act, so no one in USA should not have medical insurance) then hospitals cover the bill it's like loss prevention in stores.\n\nThis is the most telling part of it all. Stealing an iphone from Best Buy won't hurt them at all. Martin has done virtually no damage to us at all.

{"body":"\u0026gt;“This is a solicitation of assault in exchange for money,” the judge said. “That is not protected by the First Amendment.” \n\nThis part is bullshit. It is true that he did say \"try to grab a hair from her\" which was stupid of him, but he didn't require that it still be attached to her head. He could just have easily paid for people picking hairs off her seat after a book signing, which would not be assault. \n\nAt $5,000 **per hair**, if I was hillary, I would have shaved my head, delivered my ~100,000 hairs to him, asked for payment of $500,000,000, and then when he didn't pay, sued him. I bet she would have won, too, since Shkreli is so hated. So then Shkreli ends up bankrupt and Hillary is rich. \n\nThe real issue here is that Shkreli did not shut the fuck up during the most critical phase in his criminal prosecution between conviction and sentencing. He kept a high profile and made an ass of himself. This is suicidal.\n\nJudges are supposed to follow guidelines, but they can and do deviate all the time, plus the guidelines include discretionary items and the judge can change the number of points for various things.\n\nThe last thing you should do while awaiting sentencing is boast that you are not going to do real jail time, which Shkreli did multiple times. You are practically daring the judge at that point to throw the book at you. You need to disappear and give the judge no reason to make an example of you, and then AFTER you are sentenced, you can act like an idiot all you want.\n\nShkreli was probably told over and over not to do any of this shit by his lawyer, and was like \"fuck you imma get this shit right here\" and now he gets to go to jail for it.","created_utc":"1505351177","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

{"body":"\u0026gt;What does the fact that many people don't have insurance have to do with Shkreli?\n\nBecause people without insurance could no longer afford Deraprim after the price hike. At least that's the argument Shrkeli himself is addressing. What do you mean?\n\nI agree and defend Shrkeli on a lot of points, but he hasn't adequently argued that people indeed will not suffer from the price hike. He claims that no one suffers because  1. Insurance pays for it. And 2. That if you don't have insurance, you can get it for free.\n\nThe professor simply questioned whether #2 was in fact feasible. All he had to do was stay calm and say something like \"well actually it's a very simple process. There should be no reason someone without insurance can't get it\". \n\n\n\nHis argument instead is that there are much pricier drugs, and people are not dying despite their cost from a lack of insurance. This is Shrkeli argument so I am not sure what you mean by what the lack of insurance had to do with Shrkeli. But as the professor brings up, people do indeed die to lack of insurance. \n\n\u0026gt;It looks like I upvote you an awful lot [+5] so I'm kind of sad that you're going off the rails here.\n\n;(\n\n","created_utc":"1488250478","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}
{"body":"Fair response, but if I could just add to this.\n\nThe Technosphere technology behind Afrezza is patented and will be shared with RLS (whomever they may be) to develop other drugs. Under the agreement, RLS will be bearing 100% R\u0026amp;D costs for drug development, while sharing profits with MannKind.\n\nWe have already seen how this technology can work wonders at solving problems with existing drugs, not only with Afrezza but with MannKinds inhaled oxytocin. The injectable form degrades quickly, while MannKind's inhaled formulation is incredibly stable.\n\nThe potential to continue to develop both new drugs and convert existing drugs using this exact same patented delivery system could potentially be a complete game changer in the pharmaceutical world.\n\nIt is a gamble, but I continually ask myself why any bearish sentiment I read is not backed up by factual information. They say it isn't effective, there are dosing issues, but these are totally made up. Much of the info you read on SA is either misleading or outright lies, and then what a surprise at the bottom, without fail, \"full disclosure we are short MNKD\".\n\nUnfortunately this has been a very popular stock to short, thanks in part to Shkreli, but I think that the market manipulators are having their last hoorah before April. MNKD is a legitimate company with legitimate patents, innovative technology, and an FDA approved drug. It's a risky investment, but in my opinion not nearly as risky as the gambles some people take on here.\n\nBut I guess that's why I haven't lost any money the past two months.\n\nOP, you're a big girl.

{"body":"Or, you could take the opportunity to learn about the science. \"The science\" here is not a miracle. It is positive, and anyone who knows about clinical trials knows that a successful small trial, especially one with no placebo control, means nothing more than \"OK, let's try it on a bigger scale now\". Even with AVXL's data this weekend, they are still ridiculously far from having an approved drug. There are two dozen drugs in phase III or under evaluation for approval by the FDA for Alzheimer's, and another hundred or so earlier stage trials (phase I and II). Many of those are biologic drugs that have a chance to actually target the amyloid plaques that probably cause the disease.  I've seen a huge number of claims in the past few days that are simply untrue. People claiming that the trial results for AVXL were unprecedented (they weren't, and I think it's based off this interview with a guy saying \"I'VE never seen anything like this, in the one other trial I was involved with\"), that other stocks with higher valuations have a worse pipeline (def not true for AXON), etc.  \nBottom line, here's my opinion, as a scientist professionally involved with biotech investment: Before the results, Anavex's lead drug had a ~1% chance of making it to market, and the ~$6 stock price seemed nice, even a little high given competition. After the result, Anavex's lead drug has a ~1.1% chance of making it to market.  So my prediction was that the stock had no business being run up in the first place, and there was no conceivable alternative other than it running back down to where it belongs.  In the end, it does seem the stock was manipulated, but it was manipulated up, last week in advance of the results.  \nPeople want to believe. That they know a secret, that they will make a lot of money, that a terrible disease is finally about to be treated in a meaningful way. I have no idea how much of the BS was organic and how much was nefarious, but it is an error to blame what happened on Shkreli or Feuerstein or JFinDallas.

{"body":"This is absurd and one of the biggest problems with with the judicial system here in the US. Bail is put in place to ensure that the person appears for their court ordered hearings and/or trial. The court isn't using his bail to ensure he'll appear because there's absolutely no reason to believe he wouldn't at this point in the process. It's being used as a way to bludgeon him, so even if he isn't convicted, he's still getting fucked over. \n\nCase in point: The judge makes the rules. Shkreli's attorney said he had debts that he couldn't pay because he didn't have access to the funds that would allow him to do so. It's very easy for the Judge to say, \"Alright, if the reason you're asking for a bail reduction is to pay off debts, we'll release $X amount which you can use to pay off what you owe for P, Q, and R obligations.\" If he uses the money for any other purpose, the court could hold him in contempt and revoke his bail entirely. \n\nInstead, they're basically saying \"Naw, fuck it. Let the juice run. If we can't get a conviction, let's at least try to fuck him over in another way.\"\n\nThis isn't just a game they're playing to screw with Shkreli - no doubt that once all is said and done, financially, he'll be fine. It might take him a few years, but he'll come back. The problem is, it's something the court does all the time as part of their standard procedures. So if an average middle class citizen finds themselves in a criminal battle large enough, they may actually be innocent, they may be found innocent by a jury of their peers, but by the time that happens, they've literally lost everything they had worked for.

What great insight you have. \n\nJust incase there's any more insight you may looking to build upon. \n\n\n\n\nhttp://healthaffairs.org/blog/2016/09/13/memo-to-the-president-the-pharmaceutical-monopoly-adjustment-act-of-2017/\n\u0026gt;the company earned $115 billion on sales of $528 billion during the 10 years from 2006 through 2015, for an average profit of almost 22 percent. During the same period, Pfizer spent $139 billion on stock buy backs and dividends; over $155 billion on sales, informational, and administrative expenses; and only $82 billion on research. Revenues generated \nmarketing partner under the Bayh-Dole Act.\n\u0026gt;According to aggregated data from Statista, Johnson \u0026amp; Johnson earned one third of its pharmaceutical revenue between 2011 and 2015 (about $30 billion) from sales of Remicade — a federally funded discovery made at New York University. Similarly, between 2006 and 2015, Amgen derived $90 billion from the sale of Neupogen and Enbrel which were discovered by federally funded researchers at Memorial Sloane Kettering and the University of Texas. \n\u0026gt;For that $5 billion the government could have covered the entire cost of thestudies needed for the 200 drugs that have received the pediatric patent extension. Instead, the pediatric extensions generated many billions in extra revenue for dozens of blockbuster drugs having annual sales of $1 to several billion per year.\n\u0026gt;An unintended consequence of the patent extension system is that less innovative,me-too drugs like the cholesterol lowering statin, Crestor, and proton pump inhibitor, Nexium, have received longer extensions than the more innovative first member of those classes of drugs. Granting extensions for less innovative drugs serves no public interest and adds tens of billions of dollars to annual drug costs because of heavy advertising that stimulates demand for those low-value products.\n\nPatent evergreening\nhttp://theconversation.com/explainer-evergreening-and-how-big-pharma-keeps-drug-prices-high-33623\n\n\n\n\nMany times we are inhibiting innovation by protecting \"meetoo\" drugs and stifling rnd. There are some common ways to do it. \n\n3 Ways Brand names keep generics away\n\t1) Pay for delay. Effective Bribe. Brand name pays first filing generic not to come into market. Settling Hatch-Waxman. However, 6 month Duopoly period does not start until first generic actually comes to market. So this can be stretched out continuously. Congress has attempted to fix this numerous times by changing wording, but companies just keep getting nimbler with the law.  Price stays higher for a longer period of time, bad for consumers. \n\tSupreme court ruled in 2013 that this could be challenged as anti-trust. So companies moved away from the simple versions of this. \n\t\n\t2) Similar to #1, but more complex. Payments are more difficult to detect. But generic still stays off market. Maybe the Brand pays generic to do something economically idiotic, like market the drug. Or to do anything really, where the generic is a useless middleman. Ways which are much harder to detect and enforce as anti-trust. (Like paying a college athlete 10k a month to work part time in an office) Still active.\n\t\n\t3) #1 and #2 about collusion. This is about obstruction. Blocking the generics out completely. Evergreening and product hopping; minor modification to delivery or dosing get a new patent and to keep generic from enacting. \n\n\n\tAsacol; company tried to product hop. Failed. So they stuck a new patent on old capsule, by sticking a new ineffective capsule around it. Literally just took the old capsule, and stuck it inside a new one; you could cut the new capsule and the old one would fall out. But they got a new patent for it. AND, they removed all of the old drug off the market. No more equivalency. \n\n\n\n\nI can recommend several books about this if you'd actually like to learn and not meme away about shkreli. \n\nThis all excludes of course the other end of trouble with the industry. That rnd you mention. There seems to be a lot of problems there. Like 1/2 of all trials being published. But wait there's more... much more... but you'll never make it this far any way. So I'll save my efforts. ","created_utc":"1500605820","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

{"body":"Reading comprehension isn't one of ur strength, but that's ok, I'll clarify. I meant that bcuz Republicans are against socializing healthcare, we have ppl believing that they're the ones providing for their own health insurance, and not the reality that they're contributing to a pool; which is the typical republican voter's thought when they pay for health insurance. With that said, the left's whole debacle on this issue was basically blaming big money for social injustice, and Shkreli was the perfect specimen bcuz he voluntarily came out with a stereotypical image of the 1% elitist. Basically what I'm trying to say is republicans were outraged bcuz how blatantly honest Shkreli was and the republicans needed good PR with an idiot like Trump in office. Then you have the Dems who are hell bent on taking public opinions and conforming to seem like they're ppl's party, and finally following the whole idea of making heads roll on Wall street (which they didn't really do immediately following the 07 crash, as their donors are from Wall Street).\n\nNo, I'm not \"being a fanboy\". I was outraged against Shkreli's comments during his testimony regarding daraprim, but after learning about the inner details of the American healthcare system and the economics behind it, Shkreli made sense (took a health insurance economics class that was offered in my major for upper division classes, which I wrote an essay regarding the daraprim drama).","created_utc":"1507516749","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}
{"body":"Playing devil's advocate here, there are 2 issues people get upset about. \n\n1. It's currently distributed for free on an experimental basis in the US, but according to the article the price will be raised to $60k+/year (in line with hep c treatment). This could cause trouble for uninsured patients and the general trend of charging a lot for pharmaceuticals could cause premiums to rise.\n\n2. According to the article the main reason he is doing this is to get an expedited processing voucher from the FDA which could be sold for hundreds of millions. This is seen as an abuse of the voucher system which should only go to nice companies that develop drugs.\n\nBoth of these are kind of weak, but are easy to get upset about if you don't think about it a lot and come in with your mind made up.\n\nRegarding the first point, uninsured patients with a need will almost certainly be able to apply for very discounted treatment. And why shouldn't insurance companies pay for Benznidazole just because they haven't in the past? It seems to me that it is only fair that we pay about the same for treatment for diseases with similar characteristic (chronic infectious disease with potentially lethal consequences). That way we make sure there is a profit motive to develop better drugs.\n\nRegarding the second point, from a consumer point of view I don't see the difference between developing a drug or acquiring an unregulated drug. In both cases you are introducing the drug to the regulated market which is what we want to encourage. Who cares what his motivations are or whether the drug comes from your R\u0026amp;D division or an acquisition? If we really think the voucher system is being abused then we should criticize the system and those who refuse to change it. Criticizing Shkreli accomplishes nothing. He is running a public company so of course he will have to jump at the chance to apply for a $100mil+ voucher even if that was not the spirit of the system.","created_utc":"1449941821","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

You can stay in business if you sell your product at cost if you include all your expenses but I wouldn't call that a sustainable level. Healthy profit is a part of running a sustainable business.\n\nThere was r\u0026amp;d. Not by Turing I give you but by the previous owner and it wasn't priced in the undervalued drug before. Pricing it in at some point made sense. They bought a product which includes the costs of development even if you don't straight up buy the r\u0026amp;d debt.\nThat model even gives reason for an elevated pricing because the previous owner \"wasted\" some of the years of the patents lifespan.\n\nI don't get what evergreening has to do with any of my arguments or comparisons? \n\nPoint was, as you seemed to miss it, that it is generally accepted that we give value to ip and not just manufacturing costs in other product categories so it's ridiculous people are throwing hissy fits when it is done in pharma and the manufacturer gets to decide how to include it in the consumer price of the product.\n\nI didn't advocate generics production in any way and it's stupid that pharma has weaker protection for their products than other industries so if Shkreli found a way to safeguard those patents, good for him. \n\nI hadn't even heard that nor did I argue anything about that or that there even needs to be some benevolent new drug coming that justifies setting the price point of your product to whatever the hell you feel like. \n\nThere isn't an inherent obligation for private companies to help people. \n\nSlur is cool and all but it's 2017. I would at least add some \"fucks\" and a couple of death threats to be taken seriously. I can't now stop picturing you as the inner city kid from a 90's sitcom.\n\nYou seem to be arguing with the general vibe or something other people have said to you before and not with me or what I commented earlier because you didn't really address any of my points.\n\nI really haven't followed what the guy has actually said about the price hike because I never felt there should be a controversy about the thing. I just follow the space in general. \n\nIf a company owns a product it should be able to do anything it want's with it and raising the price of daraprim made sense to me personally. I feel that private ownership is a pretty basic concept in a free market so it's just lazy to try to accuse me of mirroring Shrek on this one.

He made horrible bets with MSMB shorting stocks, couldn't cover on Orexigen, and became insolvent, so he just went to found a new company to raise new funds (to cover the old losses). He said he would be exiting MSMB (after lying about doubling investors money, not losing everyone's money), and investors could cash out or convert to shares of Retrophin (which he never delivered on). He attempted to make people whole by using it as his personal banking service to cover his losses.  \n\n\nAccording to an indictment, instead of telling investors that he had lost their money, on September 10, 2012, he sent an e-mail claiming he had “just about doubled their money net of fees,”—previously having told one investor that MSMB had $35 million in its coffers when actually only $700 remained. He offered the investors a choice of cash or shares in Retrophin, where, he said, he was now going to focus his time.

{"body":"Firstly I'd disagree with the statement that Shkreli is part of the problem.

This would not have been possible without the income from daraprim; which at its previous selling price would have likely been discontinued. See https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Pharmaceuticals\n\n\nUnlike many pharmaceutical CEOs, Martin takes an active role in the chemistry behind new research. Given that tech is the fastest growing sector currently, it is not true to say that Martin is in biopharma just for profit; however profit is the sole reason to make new life saving medicines. \n\nFinally, regarding a socialistic democracy; I am not from the US and have relied on the NHS for my health-care my whole life. I appreciate that it's statistically proven that wealth is easier obtained in Scandinavian countries (for reasons outlined in the video); however I believe the US to be a much more innovative market as an aspiring investor. Being European, I find us as a collective to be overwhelming uninspiring in terms of innovation. When we make world class technology, it's usually niche and prohibitively expensive - hence Germany's solar industry getting obliterated by the Chinese, European made automobiles being mostly for the rich, having a collective space agency (ESA) that lags far behind its potential and not a single tech giant (in the top 15) growing on European soil.","created_utc":"1501170272","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

{"body":"It's not easier it's fucking irritating to go line by line with that shit, it turns everything into a debate or attack instead of a productive adult discussion. We're having a conversation now, see? It's much better.\n\nWhy did they agree to license them to begin with?  To take the drug off the market. They had sole rights to marketing the drug, per the agreement. MannKind, even, did not have the rights to market the drug during that time. This is the same thing that they got in legal trouble for it the past. It's real. It's documented that they have done it before. I believe they did it again.\n\nDon't take my word for it, google \"Genzyme Sanofi lawsuit\"\n\nThey spent WAY more money on that one too.\n\nThere are costs. I don't think it's even going to come to a lawsuit, I think they're going to settle.\n\nI think you're misunderstanding the whole, if other drugs are developed and pass the clinical part. Because it's not the drugs. It's the delivery system. Can you imagine inhalable ibuprofen? Inhalable Xanax? Any other drug that could benefit from immediate delivery into the bloodstream, with immediate effect, without the need for a needle? I'm not thinking new drug development. I'm thinking a novel, proven delivery system for existing, proven, off patent drugs. They developed inhalable oxytocin to stop bleeding during childbirth, the liquid form degrades easily but their version is extremely stable. Less degradation, less cost.\n\n It's not contradictory because MannKind was never and I don't think will ever be in the business of developing new drugs, running through clinical trials, etc etc. This is 100% about the delivery system.\n\nWhat I see in MNKD:\n\nAfter overcoming Shkreli's attempts to block Afrezza and bankrupt the company to benefit his short position, after Al Mann dumped one billion dollars of his personal fortune into the company to push past that, Sanofi swooped in and was their 'savior'. Little did they know they were about to get fucked again.\n\nSeptember 2015, Genzyme wins a legal battle against Sanofi for the same shit. MannKind starts making moves. Lawsuits are threatened behind closed doors, an agreement is reached. \n\nOctober 2015, Andrea Leone-Bay, vp of research and development at MannKind, moves over to RLS. I believe that because of the funding MannKind received via the Mintaka foundation for it's inhaled oxytocin from the gates foundation, Al Man secured from his billionaire philanthropist friends the confidence and backing of his company because of this novel delivery system. I believe an agreement was reached privately to explore what could be done with existing drugs using this new, novel delivery system to instantly get stable, sterile drugs into the bloodstream without the use of a needle.\n\nI'm not pumping it up. I'm a middle class college kid with 20 grand in the market. This is a billion dollar company. I have no association with any investment firm, no way to 'pump' this stock.\n\nI am excited about it, that's why I post about it so much. If they bought without doing their own DD, shame on them. If you read through my posts there are a ton of people who ask me if now is a good time to buy, and over and over I have said \"I don't tell people what to do with their money\". Even if I had, it would influence nothing. JPM, Goldman Sachs, WF all have large positions in this company. This is not your typical penny stock.\n\nI weigh in on threads that mention it. I dig this community and since I became a moderator I am trying to make it better, aka remove trash, so I pretty much open every thread. I'm not obsessively searching for MannKind threads. But if I see something wrong, or I have something to contribute, I say something because I have researched this company OBSESSIVELY if you can't already tell.\n\n","created_utc":"1459810304","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

He knew MannKind would be successful on the approval of Afrezza, so he used his leveraging power (untrustworthy FDA officials) in an attempt to get Afreeza rejected or delayed. Problem for him was, the FDA already gave Mannkind the nod that it would be accepted, so it was fortunately only delayed a few weeks, however, share price fell beginning of 2011.

It is probably to prevent short cartels from forming. after a company, sector, or exchange, experiences a crisis involving public shorting of their stock they tend to cry foul and those who are not prepared for litigation should usually stay away from preaching to the public to short while they themselves have short positions. \n\nAn interesting book on situations like the above is \"Fooling some of the people all of the time\". I would recommend the audible version.\n\nCalls and puts are options and handled by the cboe and not the sec so they make it so hedge funds must report both long and short positions. Cboe are real capitalist bros they even wanted to make movie box office options at one point before they were stopped.\n\nYou want to look at funds under 10 billion for a few reasons. Most company's are not worth billions and therefore more value plays do not have billions of potential alpha. Most market caps favor investments in the tens of millions as far as event driven alpha goes. You also don't want to get a fund that's too small or else you could end up with a shkreli as your fund manager or even just a lucky idiot. As far as transaction fees go if a fund is small enough they can become a factor too.\n\nEdit: you should absolutely disregard institutional purchases made by main street funds such as fidelity.

I'm guessing the response to this comment is going to be full of put downs, generalities, hearsay brought to you by the man himself shkreli. \n\n\nEssentially, the allegations are that he stole both cash and shares worth millions of dollars from Retrophin, disguising them in some cases as consulting arrangements, in order to give shares to a small group of insiders, pay off creditors and his former MSMB investors (some of whom were complaining to the S.E.C.), and settle other lawsuits. He made horrible bets with MSMB shorting stocks, couldn't cover on Orexigen, and became insolvent, so he just went to found a new company to raise new funds (to cover the old losses). He said he would be exiting MSMB (after lying about doubling investors money, not losing everyone's money), and investors could cash out or convert to shares of Retrophin (which he never delivered on). He attempted to make people whole by using it as his personal banking service to cover his losses.  \n\n\nAccording to an indictment, instead of telling investors that he had lost their money, on September 10, 2012, he sent an e-mail claiming he had “just about doubled their money net of fees,”—previously having told one investor that MSMB had $35 million in its coffers when actually only $700 remained. He offered the investors a choice of cash or shares in Retrophin, where, he said, he was now going to focus his time. A firm which sued him over an unpaid bill wrote in its lawsuit (which was eventually settled), “At bottom, Retrophin is simply Shkreli’s alter ego, formed to defraud his bona fide creditors.”\n \nIt doen't sound like you know any thing at all what he did.

{"body":"Says someone who knows nothing of what he did. You can't listen to shkreli in these things. He lies to you. Essentially, the allegations are that he stole both cash and shares worth millions of dollars from Retrophin, disguising them in some cases as consulting arrangements, in order to give shares to a small group of insiders, pay off creditors and his former MSMB investors (some of whom were complaining to the S.E.C.), and settle other lawsuits. He made horrible bets with MSMB shorting stocks, couldn't cover on Orexigen, and became insolvent, so he just went to found a new company to raise new funds (to cover the old losses). He said he would be exiting MSMB (after lying about doubling investors money, not losing everyone's money), and investors could cash out or convert to shares of Retrophin (which he never delivered on). He attempted to make people whole by using it as his personal banking service to cover his losses.  \n\n\nAccording to an indictment, instead of telling investors that he had lost their money, on September 10, 2012, he sent an e-mail claiming he had “just about doubled their money net of fees,”—previously having told one investor that MSMB had $35 million in its coffers when actually only $700 remained. He offered the investors a choice of cash or shares in Retrophin, where, he said, he was now going to focus his time. A firm which sued him over an unpaid bill wrote in its lawsuit (which was eventually settled), “At bottom, Retrophin is simply Shkreli’s alter ego, formed to defraud his bona fide creditors.”\n\nIn late 2012, Shkreli took Retrophin public through what’s known as a “reverse merger,” in which you merge a new business into an existing publicly traded shell, thereby getting stock that you can sell to investors. Such deals are so notoriously sleazy that the S.E.C. has issued a bulletin warning investors to stay away from them.\n\nDon't be gullible. Don't take a conmans word as fact.

{"body":"Shkreli's first hedge fund was setup at Lehman Brothers.  Lehman didn't actually hold the assets, they just executed the trades for Shkreli.  Orders were supposed to clear and be paid for by another account.  \n\nIn July 2007 Shkreli went YOLO on 20,000 contracts of SPY puts for over $2.6 million.  Lehman executed the trade for him, but when the transaction went to clear there was no money in his account to pay for it.  He was of course hoping the price would go up and he would be able to sell the contracts to cover the purchase price.  That didn't happen and they ended up losing 90% of their value within two days.  At this point Lehman liquidated the options and realized a loss of over $2.3 million, which they sued Shkreli to try and collect.\n\nJust think about how crazy that is.  Going all in for your personal account on a single option contract that can easily expire worthless is insanely reckless, but he took it two steps further.  He didn't even put up his own funds to do this gamble, it was his investor's capital.  And then he took it one step further.  He used their money to setup the account, effectively giving him credit at Lehman, and then maxed out that credit on put options.  \n\nSo that's like a triple YOLO.  All in on a highly leveraged instrument, bought in an account funded by others, in an amount greatly in excess of what funds were ever available.\n\nTL;DR:  Our hero was also responsible for the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and therefore the financial crisis.

{"body":"Full story is: with investors' money he started a company called Retrophin. When it started he went public to generate cash and put some capital back on the hedge fund while the hedge fund had a nice stake on it and it was doing R\u0026amp;D or looking for drugs to acquire (essentially looking for income). The problem up to this point is that the equity he had on Retrophin could've been held under a different entity (hence the fund had less than $1000 in equity). Which means that the money was gone until his shares on Retrophin were worth as much as he invested (back then Retrophin' market cap was less than a million. Penny stock). The stock recovered and the company's worth jumped to ~$60,000,000 around April 2013, which is when he paid the investors back, I assume, with Retrophin shares.\n\nSo as a hedge fund, instead of investing in public companies, he started one. It's not illegal, but since the money probably went to a lot of places it shouldn't have gone to (possible use of company money for 'fake' meetings and whatnot) they can sue to see WHERE the money went to, and see if it was, in fact, just Shkreli 'transfering' money from somewhere else to these other people.\n\nBut the thing is, most/all of his investors ended with their investment + returns back, so it's IMPOSSIBLE that he was running a Ponzi, otherwise he have SOMEONE who lost money. But since what he did with Retrophin is on the verge of being illegal (and he probably knew it all along) he had to use a good lawyer.","created_utc":"1498829465","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

{"body":"\u0026gt; Then why even interview/depose the woman that made money. Why not show us some of these people that actually lost money.\n\nThe answer to this question basically boils down to:  because ponzi schemes are manageable.\n\n...and here it's important to note that most people consider social security to be a ponzi scheme, in addition to most, if not all, MLMs.\n\nThe reason that social security and MLMs get away with being a running ponzi schemes (beyond the former having state credibility) is because these schemes have mechanisms in place for preventing collapse. With social security, a combination of actuarial reality, inflation and pay-out adjustments allow the scheme to continue indefinitely.  In the case of MLMs, substantiative collapse is prevented by having the middle of the pyramid work at subsistence levels (there's no expectation that the middle will make money).  The lower bleeding edge of the pyramid restrains participation (thus population exhaustion) by having a high barrier (must invest at least \u0026gt;$5kl to join the pyramid at the lowest level) and a mechanism to fail these \"investors\" (they call them distributors to avoid an expectation of a positive outcome) out of the pyramid after directing their \"investment\" up the pyramid (they'll have a garage full of product once that happens, but a transaction will have taken place, thus no ponzi... at least that's the theory).\n\nWhen you take someone's money with the expectation of generating a return using a certain strategy/structure (as detailed in the prospectus), you need to be very clear about how this proceeds.\n\nIf he took money the intention of generating a 100% loss after transferring the proceeds into an entirely separate corporate vehicle not documented under the original structure's books and only started returning the funds (even with a profit) once investors started to complain, then you've got a fraud situation.  \n\nSee MF Global to understand the restrictions hedge funds have on client money.  As a hypothetical, suppose MF Global had been successful in Mr. Corzine's  eurozone debt bets and returned all of that improperly borrowed money back into his brokerage customer's account.  Then, let's say, a few week later, Mr. Corzine starts spouting off anti-semitic remarks about Jews running New York, Hollywood or whatever.  What do you want to bet the odds are that he would have ended up in exactly Mr. Shkreli's situation.  I'd say they'd be pretty god damned high.\n\nMr. Shkreli probably did something wrong, got lucky and compensated his investors to shut them up, but he then went a little too far and too public during a period of the American economic zeitgeist where that sort of behavior was ground for increased/further scrutiny given the vast reach social media affords.","created_utc":"1498828257","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

{"body":"That doctor asked what the difference between Pyrimethamine and Daraprim is, but they are the same drug so that doesn't really make sense. It's just cheaper in India. In regards to Shkreli's plans to create a better drug it's clear that they don't have anything ready yet, he is just speaking about what they would want to come out of R\u0026amp;D. Obviously there is no useful way to compare a real drug to a fantasy drug.\n\nThe doctor talks about counteracting nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, but these are not the serious side effects of which Shkreli was speaking. Maybe this doctor is mainly using it as a malaria medication, but when used for toxoplasmosis you need a much higher dose. You can't just give folate infusion in case of folate deficiency, you need to suspend treatment with daraprim. The [prescribing information](http://www.daraprimdirect.com/Content/downloads/DARAPRIM_Prescribing_Information.pdf) specifically states:\n\n\u0026gt; Hypersensitivity reactions, occasionally severe (such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis,\n erythema multiforme, and anaphylaxis), and hyperphenylalaninemia, can occur particularly when pyrimethamine is\n administered concomitantly with a sulfonamide. \n\n\u0026gt; ...\n\n\u0026gt; Doses used in toxoplasmosis may produce megaloblastic\n anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, atrophic glossitis, hematuria, and disorders of cardiac rhythm.\n Hematologic effects, however, may also occur at low doses in certain individuals (see \nPRECAUTIONS; General)\n\nNone of which Ondansetron or Pantoprazole would help with. Also it's recommended (when used for toxoplasmosis) to administer a sulfonamide concomitantly.\n\n\nI wouldn't but too much weight on whatever bio-babble comes out of Shkreli's mouth as he is not qualified to design drugs and one must assume that he leaves that to people who understands the science thoroughly at his (former?) companies. I don't doubt that a qualified scientist could poke holes in stuff he says, but what matters is the general idea to spend on R\u0026amp;D and hopefully develop a better drug while also serving the current patients as well as possible and not burdening the insurance system worse than treatments for comparable diseases (mid 5 figures for a course of treatment is not outrageous).","created_utc":"1450618707","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

To make money they need to sell either more drugs or the same number of drugs at a higher cost. As the drug Shkreli is infamous for has a finite number of potential patients, the only option to raise money for R\u0026amp;D is to hike the price.\n\nNow the drug that shkreli bought is very old and largely ineffective with lots of side effects. A new version *is* needed, but as it is a rare disease big pharma isn't interested in doing the expensive research themselves. It does make sense to raise money for research, but Shkreli trolling didn't help us legitimate cause","created_utc":"1505638029","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

Only Retrophin would have any standing against him, since they were the entity that was harmed. Everyone else that invested with him walked away better off, so what damages could they reasonably argue to receive? Isn't Shkreli is a co-founder of retrophin? He probably had the legal standing to give away the shares that he did. \n\nThis is clearly a politically motivated case against a man that has improved the quality of healthcare in this country while putting 80% of his profits into R\u0026amp;D.

{"body":"Private companies generally don't do very frequent and small transfers of shares. Often they come with complicated terms that you'd want your lawyer to look over anyway, even if it's all codified in an enforceable smart contract. If I do an issue worth $400,000 I don't really care that I pay $50 for someone to enter that into an Excel spreadsheet.\n\nWe already know how to automate transactions and transfers of share. We have like 11 registered stock exchanges and hundreds of dark pools that each have their own take on how exactly to do it, and all while trying to adhere to complicated regulation. In that case the blockchain solves a problem that already has a solution.\n\nThere is certainly room for improvement, especially when it comes to simple standardized operations backed by verifiable assets and not just a measure of trust. However we need to seriously consider what new issues we may be introducing and when we are doing the new cool thing just because it's cool rather than because it's useful. I haven't seen a detailed document explaining how overstock plans to design this (does such a thing exist publicly yet?) but they don't seem to consider the many issues that they may introduce.\n\n* Spoofing: If there is a latency of more than a microsecond where unverified transactions can be posted anonymously on the ledger (they use the blockchain as a ledger I guess), then spoofing will be an immense problem.\n\n* How to ensure equally fast access to information: When someone tries to post an order on the ledger, or a confirmation of a transaction it will take a while for it to distribute across the decentralized system. How do we ensure that there aren't people that use superior networks and computational resources to effectively \"frontrun\" (in the HFT sense) others? People love criticizing colo arrangements at exchanges as benefiting the rich guys at the expense of the little guys, but fact is that if you pay a million or so no one gets faster access than you, and any decent firm can scrape that together. With a decentralized system it's much harder to keep latency fair.\n\n* How to allow leverage or trust-based transactions: We want to allow leverage so we can't always require that you prove mathematically that you can pay. It's enough that you demonstrate a fraction of the ability to pay and a promise (in the smart contract) to liquidate if you're approaching your limit. There are even trades such as short sales which have unlimited downside so you can never guarantee 100% that you will be able to pay. If you short KBIO before Shkreli buys it and refuses to lend out his shares, then you may end up with a loss of many times what would've been thought reasonable. In the current system you now have a legal debt to your broker which covered your position, but how is this handled in smart contracts?\n\n* Is the blockchain made for the immense number of transactions that HFT will bring, especially with lower transaction costs? (I have no idea, just asking the question) I have already seen people in the bitcoin community refer to this sidechannel as spam.\n\n* Can the technology sustain malicious attacks? Is it possible to DDoS the blockchain to such an extent that you render the blockchain based stock market non-functional? What about targeted attacks that benefit you?","created_utc":"1450291413","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

{"body":"For me it's a two part system. Part 1) Get good enough that you know you can win on trades. That doesn't mean winning everytime. No one does. It means that more often than not you're not wining by luck and you can trust your ideas. Forgive yourself for doing what even the best of the best do. In fact even admitting a position is a loss puts you above the majority of people in the market who cling desperately to the idea of being proven right in the end. That leads me to: Part 2) Control your losses. Loss control is the test of whether or not you're ready to handle scale and leverage. If you can't take a $100 loss on $10,000, you aren't going to be able to take a $1,000 loss on $100,000. Stay in the shallow end until you know you can swim. This not easy to do, again, forgive yourself because even the best fall in love with their ideas and lose more than they should.\n\nThe combination of these means that you can have the confidence to take the loss on bad trades and if you're doing things right, no one loss should ever cripple you. You *know* you're going to win again. Losses suck, but they humble you and there is value in humility. It's an easy trait to lose in this game. In the future you'll control your losses better and if you don't trust yourself to do that, play smaller until you can. Those two ideas sound so simple, but they are goals to strive for and you aren't an idiot, a bad person, or even a bad trader no matter what your ego screams at you. You made a mistake. Forgive yourself for making a mistake. Strive to be better or cut your losses on the game entirely and try to find a different way to make money that fits better for you.

I could add a lot of shit to that list that he left out, and that's not going to do a damn thing about making shkreli me actions better all. Let's take a look. \n\nTgn1412 horrible phase 1. Google that one. This is something which has happened again. People dying and shit. \n\n\nExpedited drug approval in 96 for midodrine, on extremely weak trials based on surrogate blood pressure rise levels, and that Shire would conduct follow up studies. The trials never came. In 2010, FDA announced that it would be taken off market unless shire produced trials, and shire didn't give a shit because they now only produced 1% of the drug on market. Patient groups lobbied to  keep drug on the market. \nNo trials have been done. \nPost approval trials agreed to be done after expedited approval  were looked at and over 1/3 of them had not been done between 1992 and 2008. General accounting office. \n\n\nThe thing is many expressed passed drugs, there's now 4 ways of doing doing so by the way, end up having problems... \n\n\n\n\n\nLet's have a look at trial bias/fraud in publishing trials. Do you think the trials showing a drug worked or doesn't work end up getting published, because 1/2 of all trials never make it. \n\nAntidepressant papers  published over two decades of approved drugs were looked at. \n12500 patients in 74 trials, with 38 trials showing positive resluts for new drugs. \n37/38 + were published\n3/34 not positive were published. \n11 of the negative trials were in the literature, but were written as if the drug was a success! \nSo reality is 38+ and 37-, while the literature showed 48+ and 3- trials. Absurd! \n\n\nHere's the fix, alas, it's not at all been enforced! \"FDA modernization act \"create clinical trials.gov but only required studies to register if new drug was going to be on market for life threatening diseases. Nothing happened.\n2007 FDA amendment act was passed, requires registration of all trials besides first in man tests if they have any site in the US or any application to bring it to market. AND, results of trials must be posted for any marketed drug that completes after 2007. \nDoes nothing for trials published before today. \nAnd only 1/5 trials still seems to meet their obligations. \n\n1/3 post marketing trials, know what those are?,  agreed to be conducted never occur, and not one drug was taken off of the market. \n\n\nTrovan antibiotic by Pfizer in Nigeria about how Phizer hired investigators to blackmail politicians to get them to drop the federal lawsuit. \n\n\nDoxazosin, a BP reduceder, was found to be just as effective as a off patent drug at reducing BP. Through later study of a gov funded trial, which had to be stopped, it was found to be doing much worse with heart attacks. The drug stayed on the market and prescriptions didn't budge. \n\n\nIressa, cancer drug by AstraZeneca for third line option, was shown to be effective by surrogate test of reducing size of tumor by 10%, in 139 patients. They pushed for rushed approval. It did not occur before other trial data came in. The drug showed no benefit in real survival outcome, nor even in tumor size reduction, in 2,000 patients.  But 12,000  were on the drug in an \"expanded acess programs\" and fought for approval. AstraZeneca even funded sending some patients to attend FDA advisory committee. The drug, which didn't work,was approved. This was confirmed in yet another large study. Another drug came out for third line and was shown to be effective. Iressa staid on the market. \n\n\nAll horrible fucked up shit. I could go on. But care to tell me how any of this relates to letting that cunt off the hook? Even with this in context, shkreli is still out scumbagging the shitty processes we have in place which allow these bad things to be common. \n\nAre you aware of his chaggas sequence? Give that a google and his fucking scheme slimbagging because I doubt you have. Maybe when you do some actual research, and not just parrot from a conman, you'll be able to make a better informed decision.

{"body":"Gentlemen, it's my time to shine. Let me polish up my fedora while you fags take a seat.\n\nThere are a set of older magic cards that have high value and collectability. They are known as \"reserve list cards\". \n\nOnce upon a time, parent company of magic the gathering \"wizards of the coast\" had a set where they reprinted a lot of highly required playable good cards, known in the game as \"staples\". This crashed the secondary market. Now, they wouldn't normally give a fuck since their money is made by selling sealed product, for which the contents are unknown until you peel the wrapper off- for the most part. But so many players were upset by the devaluation of their hard earned staples that they just quit playing. So WOTC made the promise of the reserve list- the promise that anything on the reserve will never be reprinted and therefore never devalued in that way. This is credited with saving the game. \n\nA few days ago, some guy(Craig Berry) confessed to buying out reserved list cards, and cards that, although not on the reserve list, are way too overpowered and/or unique to ever be reprinted. This guy bought in at 20 copies of a card names Gaea's Cradle for 80$ and now look that shit up. You may find current prices for any magic card and even a price history graph spanning years at magic.tcgplayer.com.  As you gain see, by buying out the very limited supply of these rare cards from the online card shop market, their pricing algorithm spikes the price way up until the supply is replenished. The replenishment of online stock is very slow for these rare cards. In other words, this kind of buyout is a wet dream for you faggots- assuming you know what cards are really rare and have a good sense on what isn't reprintable. You also need to very carefully unload them- slow enough so that the supply and demand wont ruin the spike, but fast enough so that you aren't trapped before the full rebound. But hey- there is no FTC to fuck you over, and the only company with the power to stop you has their hands tied by this ancient promise they have sworn they will never break.\n\nShikreli definitely has players scared about the reserve list though. Until now, magic speculation had never attracted buyers of this caliber, even with multiple dedicated and large magic speculation sites because you need the aforementioned understanding to do it right. And also, a lot of magic speculation is not really worth your time. It's shit like buy into a 10$ card then wait 6 months then sell at 16$ each after shipping fees. It's usually milk money unless you make a full time job out of it, at which point you're probably make 30k a year tops even with finding sick craigslist deals from people who don't know their cards value or ripoff trading kids or whatever.\n\nnow for links-\n\nhttp://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Reserved_List\n\nour own god and savior begins to learn, attracted by the aformentioned gaeas cradle speculator and how bad it trolled the magic community. The twitter post in OP followed.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4rm2x6/advice_for_a_new_and_wealthy_player/\n\nGaeas Cradle, Moat, Lion's Eye Diamond, and Serras Sanctum ( remember, you can look up prices and histories for this shit at magic.tcgplayer.com )\nspeculator who inspired our god with proof it was him\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/4qu5q9/lions_eye_diamond_buyout/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/4r66wy/craig_the_buyout_guy_explaining_his_decision/\n\nand- because i know youre a bunch of lazy ass faggots- links for these insane gains... again, assuming Craig Berry gets out before supply is restored. In case you cucks don't understand the graph, Craig bought at that minimum right before the gigantic spike of each card. Notice also- the sread on these things is on the chart. They're all volatile as fuck right now. Are you hard yet?\n\nhttp://shop.tcgplayer.com/magic/mirage/lions-eye-diamond?partner=mtgtcg\n\nhttp://shop.tcgplayer.com/magic/urzas-saga/gaeas-cradle\n\nhttp://shop.tcgplayer.com/magic/urzas-saga/serras-sanctum\nyou can even previous buyout spikes/ pump and dump on the above card. lol!\n\nhttp://shop.tcgplayer.com/magic/legends/moat\nHoly shit that moat buyout! He got in at 200 a pop and now its 600 a pop. That aint no fucking milk money.\n\nAnyway, black lotus wont work with that price shit because black lotus is just that rare. It's not sold on that site, and when it is there are too few for a good graph. It's not literally the rarest card in the game due to gimmicky one-of promos and misprints and whatever, but it is the most iconic and valuable and you won't get one for less that 1200 in any respectable condition. A graded 10 one for the oldest printing, \"alpha\" was listed last year for a cool 100K. A full 4x set of 9.8 grade alpha was listed just a few days ago for a casual 1.4 million. This game can have some balls.\n\nThere is no telling how much Shkreli will gain on this black lotus buyout. The last time there was any movement on the card, it was estimated that perhaps a dozen or so of it and each of the other pieces of the power nine ( so known for the being the most iconic and powerful and rare cards ever) were bought for legitimate reasons when some other older cards that weren't nearly as good had crept up in value so savvy players traded them in as credit toward the various pieces of power nine. The prices of each power nine piece tripled and the prices have stuck. There is absolutely no telling what a giant black lotus buyout would do. Sky is not even the limit. Maybe Pluto is.\n\nThe only thing to hate is that these buyouts aren't yolos, they are slam dunks. Again- assuming you buy in bulk then sell before supply is restocked, and you know what to target. Comment or PM with questions and I'll do my best. I might do another post with more insight into this company in general.\n\n/u/martinshkreli\n\n\n\n","created_utc":"1467907384","subreddit":"wallstreetbets"}

A corporation might be making billions every year by hiking countless small drugs, but they are in some respects subsidizing *other* companies who fail in their endeavors. Failed research is still research. And for every company that succeeds, countless others have not -- yet still contribute valuable knowledge needed in future clinical trials.
