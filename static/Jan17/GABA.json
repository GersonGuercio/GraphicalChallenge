{"body":"Your body cleaves the N-Nicotinoyl part of picamilon once it crosses the BBB and therefore it becomes GABA directly, Phenibut does not turn into GABA in the brain neither does GHB in significant amounts. I'm just clearing up the biochemistry behind it, but there is a difference whether you think it's relevant or not. Phenibut and GHB are not GABA pro-drugs, they are GABA analogues that have their own effects that are stronger than your body's natural GABA. Picamilon is a GABA prodrug that works to increase GABA levels directly in the brain, and as far as we know it does not bind to GABA receptors at all without first being converted to GABA after crossing BBB. ALL Im saying is Phenibut and GHB are vastly different from something that directly inreases GABA levels in the brain. Phenibut and GHB bind to the receptors themselves and do not get converted to GABA, they are GABA analogues but never get turned to GABA inside the body in significant levels. I never said he should take anything I'm just providing scientifically accurate information about what does what and how it affects your GABA system (not just by being an agonist, but by also increasing levels of GABA in the brain, both are totally valid forms of obtaining gabaergic effects in the end, both have their strenghts and weaknesses).","created_utc":"1501946437"}
{"body":"The way I see human enhancement, there are at least three paths that can work together-  lifestyle/activities, chemical/pharm/vitamins, and technological/biological mod.  I won't cover the latter since beyond prosthetics and AR the tech really isn't there.  Within these buckets, there is the practical intellectual, creative intellectual and physical areas that I tried and am going to again try to increase performance in.\n\nI'm going to cover just a few things, I can post later a full recap but I've also tried a number of \"recreational\" substances that have therapeautic benefit in these areas (like kava, kratom, mescaline, etc)\n\n&gt; any recommendations regarding what did and did not work?\n\n**what worked**\n\nPiracetam worked really well for me.  From my notes, which I can post in a separate thread, 1600mg + 250mg choline over the course of a few weeks really upped my ability to remember details from class and quickly recall details from conversations with people.  There was an alertness component noticed early on.  I remember taking it while doing a quant heavy course requirement (i was in an undergrad business program) Operations Management (think 6 sigma sort of shit) and got an A.  I was smoking marijuana regularly and drinking on weekends - as well as working out regularly - during this time.  I noticed a reduced desire to drink during this time and an increased response to alcohol - I think thats because piracetam affects the GABA system in some way.\n\nPiracetam reduced my need for coffee but synergized well with it.  I noticed less caffeine produced anxiety.  It was around this time I actually developed a coffee habit that unfortunately I was unable to kick for a while even after I tapered off of piracetam.  When I tapered off, there was no immediate change but I think over time I returned to my natural less focused state of consciousness.  I also developed a hand tremor around this time, but I suspect that was related to either caffeine or stress due to doing a full courseload and working 20 hrs a week at a consulting internship.  The tremor ceased after like 4 months.\n\nPhenibut worked almost too well and is less drowsy than xanax.  It seemed habit forming for a guy like me who needs to chill more so I didn't experiment with it too much.  I thought about getting some more Phenibut but my GP will give me xanax occasionally due to my travel schedule (helps me sleep on international flights) and I don't need to start a bad habit.\n\nYoga really fucking works.  I used to do Kundalini Yoga (on my own) and I may start up again once im in better shape.  Its tough to do right if you arent already in good shape - but it relaxes you, helps your flexibility and gives you more control over your body.  Back in college and the immediate years following, yoga definitely helped the quality of my sex life and lifting weights helped the quantity/variety.\n\n**what didn't**\n\nI tried St Johns Wort (SJW) to treat self diagnosed dysthymia.  It did not do very much beyond placebo and after 6 months of testing dose I ceased treatment and it eventually got worse, resulting in full blown anxiety &amp; depression.  I dont think the SJW really did anything for better or for worse for me.  I also tried things like 5htp and l tyrosine.  Nada.  Only thing that kicked this things ass was Zoloft and a few years of therapy.\n\n&gt; Anything around today that you wish was around 8 years ago?\n\nI'm not sure modafinil and similar substances were really widespread though there were talks of it on forums.  Adrafinil definitely wasn't around.  There is also more evidence that you should take larger doses of piracetam now then I think was around 8 years ago.  Back then it was 800-1600mg recommendations.  I don't think there was much of a forum for purity testing of these things either.\n\nFinally, I used adderall to study a lot and the come down was hard.  Adderall XR was better but Vyvanse really changed the game and in my mind is the best amphetamine salt type drug for therepeautic purposes - but it still has the drawbacks of amphetamines such as tolerance and cardio side effects.\n\nWe had Erowid back then but I think interest in nootropics has really taken off as the whole \"upgrade/singularity\" lifestyle has become more mainstream.\n\nAnother thing unrelated to nootropics - I didn't know about buffered creatine back then.  Its a game changer for me.  No more sugary drinks with tons of creatine monohydrate - just 1 or 2 pills of kre-alkalyn and water.\n\n&gt; Lifestyle wise, what had that biggest payoff 8 years later?\n\nI think all the research I was doing and experimentation was motivated by a pure desire to be better - and in doing so, I was also able to acknowledge a lot of flaws and realize that in some ways, I was self medicating.  So that laid the groundwork for me seeking help on my depression and adhd.\n\nThings like the racetams then and amps now get me through school and work when needed, but they didn't and don't really change my life in anyway.\n\nThe best thing I ever did was therapy for those psychological sorts of things.  And it really improved my relationship with my family, friends, significant others and with substances.  Zoloft definitely helped here.\n\nThe other big thing is exercise.  I regret that I ever stopped though for a while I was focused on building muscle that I forgot about having a balanced body.  When I was a kid I used to love rock climbing.  A few years ago, before I stopped working out entirely and was just lifting, I went to a rock gym and I could do the easy courses without issue.  But the moderate and hard kicked my ass and I couldnt complete what I used to do easily as a kid - I focused too much on mass without building true strength.  So I recommend focusing on body weight exercise, cardio and plyometrics.  Make sure you are balancing mass with practical strength.  The mass I built, however, still pays off now since my biceps and triceps are still pretty jacked and starting to get defined again now that Im dieting and exercising.\n\nGet in the habit of exercising and DO NOT STOP ever!\n\nFinally, the few times i took mescaline were really amazing experiences with a lot of breakthroughs about life, reality and nature.  Its not for everyone but it was good for me.  If you are thinking about using psychedelics for improving creativity or getting to know your inner world, mescaline is the most gentle of the natural classical psychedelics (tryptamines and phenylethylamines).  In fact, I would stick to phenylethylamines in general since they are \"gentler.\" \n\nPS.  Take a multivitamin every day and drink lots of water. I take Optimen.\n","created_utc":"1404745122"}
{"body":"Short answer, yes it's safe. No you're not going to die.\n\nLong answer, it has GABA, although in a really small dose and it isn't in a form that can cross your blood brain barrier so it doesn't affect your GABA system too much. GABA is a slowing system in your brain, a brake. Many drugs such as alcohol and benzodiazepines bind to ion channel protein GABA-A's and therefore increase the amount of GABA in your brain. Too many drugs boosting your GABA levels can be fatal, but if you supply the GABA in the form it is in Alpha Brain, it isn't harmful. From a quick look on their web site, I don't see any other potential things to promote interaction with alcohol. Well, Vinpocetine is a vasodilator, as is alcohol with lower doses. You could feel orthostatic hypotension or other dizziness, but that is unlikely. Now I'm just drawing this too far. Just go and drink.","created_utc":"1321512444"}

I felt some pretty weird tingling/burning sensations in my limbs which I have never felt before... closest thing I could relate it to is a niacin flush without the... well, flush. \n\nI didn't really notice any sort of mental effect, but I did have a pretty terrifying sleep paralysis episode about an hour after going to bed. I was stuck in a loop where when I closed my eyes, a tooth would start vibrating, then wiggling, very painfully. Felt like someone was pushing down right in the middle of my face. \n\nThis is weird because I'm pretty familiar with the feeling of waking up and drifting back into REM sleep because I am an occasional lucid dreamer, but I never reach that point only an hour after bed, more like 4-5 hours. Also, this is the first time a sleep paralysis episode has been physically painful. I've always enjoyed the creepy vibe and weird hallucinations, being familiar with deliriant and hallucinogenic experiences. This time I had to get up for thirty minutes an do things to take my mind off the anxiety.\n\nI'm almost positive the tingling was the GABA, especially since after I experienced it I looked it up and others have corroborated the experience. The sleep paralysis I have no idea about... it has been a pretty crazy and anxiety-inducing day (started making plans to move and my brother got jumped) so I'm sure that could have contributed to the SP. I'm a bit worried that the correlation between taking GABA then having terrifying SP could be made in my brain though, meaning taking it could spike anxiety and effectively lead me to it again.\n\nHowever, the fact that the stomach has GABA receptors interests me because my anxiety does manifest itself physically in my gut like many others. I don't know the pharmacology of the GABA system well enough, though, so I guess further experimentation is necessary. It's fairly cheap stuff anyway.","created_utc":"1397766796"}
{"body":"They both works on the GABA system so technically speaking, they are both inhibitors...\n\nTheanine is the precursoe for GABA. It works by inhibiting anxiety and stress. Rhodiola works the same way by inhibiting monoamine oxidase. It is not recommended probably because you probably get an overload that result in a sleepy, sedated state to function properly. \n\nRhodiola also work on the sertonin and dopamine system to increase mood and fight depression. So I suppose you can take both, but in different quantity to avoid any problem. The body can only process certain level of a substance anyway. So the trick is finding the right mixture and balance. In fact, most cognition drinks and supplements aim specific at that goal. Most even go out and state it. I know AlphaBrain explicitly stated it. \n\n","created_utc":"1323094461"}
{"body":"I don't think so...\n\nCaffeine works on 3 systems: Adenosine, Adrenaline, and Dopamine. It inhibits Adenosine receptors (aka Adenosine is what make you feel sleepiness and relax. So stopping it means it you will be wake and alert). It creates adrenaline to make you hyperactive. Finally, it increase Dopamine (aka the fight or flight state as well as pleasure and arousal). \n\nPiracetam works on the ACH system with minor effect on GABA system. \n\nIf you are taking Nootropics that works on the similar 3 systems, then Yes it will caused any overload. Similar to taking double the caffeine dosage. However, because different drugs work differently, when you combined them, they also increase their effects on each other. So it won't be a double caffeine dosage, but like 5x its dosage depending on its synergy. \n\nAlphaBrain works on the GABA and Dopamine system. Just look at the ingredients, it tell ya everything. \n\n-Vinpocetine is a vasodilator (it increases blood flow)\n-GPC Choline is another name for Alpha-GPC which increase ACH in the brain\n-Mucuna create L-DOPA which turn into dopamine, adrenaline, or non-adrenaline\n-GABA is just GABA, it works on the GABA system to control mood and make you feel relax and calm\n-Vitamin Bs are energy sources for the cell as well an various benefits\n-Oat straw is also works on GABA system and an anti-anxiety substance\n-Bacopa is similar to Oat straw\n-Ptero is similar to resveratrol (found in grape) is an anti-oxidant and protect the cell from damage\n-AC-11 is similar to anti-oxidant, but protect the DNA from damage\n\nSo in short, AlphaBrain is a nootropic that focus on mood control, cells protection, and increase energy.

{"body":"You have A LOT of stimulants there...\n\nI am not a fan of stimulants. It has a funny way for speeding you up while shortening your overall lifespan. I personally that think it is worth the cost. I however do approved of natural stimulants found in foods and plants that you can eat. \n\nI notice that you might be a downer type who relay on stimulants to get up and out, but have you ever consider the alternative. By alternative, I meant inhibitors. Let me explain if you haven't already know about neurotransmitters and how they work. There are two types: one that fire/execute the action (aka excitor) or not fire/not perform the action (aka inhibitor). \n\nIf you feel down and out, you might have an overactive suppressor neuroactivity going on. By using stimulants, you are telling your body to fire more activities to override the what is causing you to be down and out. That result in overload of the senses because you have too much going on.\n\nMy solution is try inhibiting the down feeling instead of using stimulants. If those feeling down fire, you wouldn't feel them. There are many inhibitors depending on what you want to achieve. GABA system control the relax and main inhibitory activities. You list several that work on the GABA system in your \"Attack Dose\". But too much can lead to a down, sleepy state, too. \n\nThe trick is knowing what to turn off and what to turn on. Your body does it naturally by 1) your genetic coding and 2) your past lifestyle. One way to change your life is by taking supplements/drugs. Another way to simply NOT do what you do normal and do something else.

{"body":"Wow, I thought what what you said and I had a 1 hour discussion to myself. It was endless. So I can write a 1000 words essay about long-term and short-term memory in a matter of minutes. Studying is another 1000 words essay by itself. So for the sake of conversation and simplicity, let stick to very specific topic with no intertwining topics.\n\nThe question is what nootropic is best for studying, right?\n\nAny racetam, pramiracetam is the best in my opinion. But it help to add a few other supplements for their special property. When you study, you're notorious for not focusing, especially for long period of time. Pramiracetam fixes that problem. You need a support of Pramiracetam, a choline source. So Alpha-GPC is the best choline. \n\nYou will also become tired and out of energy during studying. So you need a stimulant or energy booster to fix that problem. Caffeine is fine around 500mg a day, which is 5 cups of coffee in equivalent. Vitamin B is better because it help energize you at the mitochondria level. Sugar is notorious for crashes. Avoid it. \n\nYou also feeling tired and out of shape due to the long period of studying. So to fix that, do quick exercises that speed up blood flow and keep the body from slowing down. Also eating healthy foods and drink plenty of water to keep the body up to speed. No use having a focus and fast mind if the body is dying for rest and excitement. Take your multivitamins and protein shake. You need the amino acids. \n\nTaking quick naps recharge the mind and make learning easier. Better if you know how to enter REM and lucid dreams.\n\nTake some supplements on the GABA system to help you relax while focus. Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, or L-Dopa works. \n\nUse vasodilator like Vinpocetine or increase blood flow to provide more oxygen to the brain to allow better thinking like Picamilon. \n\nMost of studying come down to the techniques and motivations rather than a simple nootropic. Study in quiet environment with good background noise help. Use picture, rhyme, song, or story for studying, it makes it easier to recall them later. Avoid bad situations like arguments or relationship matter. Emotions are bad for studying. Use Q &amp; A game with a buddy help like playing Jeopardy. Use hierarchy learning style by simplifying large amount of information into simple sentence to outline to one word like how a book presented with title, outline, chapter, and full text information.

I think all of them can drastically improve verbal fluency, so just find the one that works best for you (there are some nootropic sites where you can buy sample packs, that may be a good idea for you).\n\nAnd some advice: Don't mess around with your GABA system - this is what a lot of anti-convulsants work on and these GABA drugs such as benzodiazepines, Phenibut, etc, are mostly highly addictive and make your anxiety worse than before you ever started.","created_utc":"1456442904"}

Taking Phenibut 3 times a week won't cause you any significant damage whereas taking Phenibut for 3 months and then withdrawing quickly would give you some heavy excitotoxicity. As for drug-induced damage versus stress-induced damage goes I'm not sure. That's pretty up-in-the-air. We know stress is bad for the brain but we don't know exactly how bad. I really don't have any knowledge when it comes to this. When it comes to repairing damage I'm also not an expert but I can probably shed some light as I'm someone who has gone through benzo withdrawals and has talked to doctors and other people who have used benzos for long periods of time and stopped. There is definitely some degree of permanent damage but it's usually not debilitating. Alcohol and benzo withdrawal can take up to 2 years depending on the individual and the amount they took and how long they took it for. Time is the only thing that helps. The brain will slowly rebuild its endogenous GABA system and through a healthy lifestyle, one can hope that their brain fixes most of what was fucked up by the excitotoxicity. There really isn't any way that I know of to grow back these lost or damaged neurons but excessive glutamate during the withdrawal process can be attenuated by NMDA antagonists or anticonvulsants. If someone is going to use GABAergics for long periods of time (which isn't advisable) I would highly recommend adding some sort of safety net, whether it be Memantine or some anticonvulsant.

This isn't damaging over the short term (drinking, taking the occasional benzo) but people using alcohol or benzos for months on end are going to experience quite a bit of damage.  \n\n Let's say someone is on benzos for a year. Their brain is completely reliant on the benzo as its inhibitory mechanism as the endogenous GABA system has been replaced by the drug. Every time that person misses a dose by an hour or so they'll experience large amounts of excitotoxicity as the brain no longer has its own inhibitory network. Over time these bursts of excitotoxicity lead to heavy brain damage. This is called kindling. It's far more common in alcoholics because they don't necessarily 'schedule' their drinks. When the booze wears off, their brain goes on the fritz with a glutamate storm. This is why benzo and alcohol withdrawals are so dangerous and damaging compared to opiate withdrawals. This is thought to be why benzos are physically damaging to the brain over the long term.

GABAB receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors that function as heterodimers of GABAB(1) and GABAB(2) subunits. In addition to highly selective agonists and antagonists, novel GABAB receptor tools have been developed recently to further assist elucidation of the role of GABAB receptors in CNS function.

{"body":"I have, out of necessity, been reading extensively on sleep regulation and supplements. I have to say it is an incredibly complex problem, once some sort of dis-regulation occurs. Like /u/Jackolysis says, melatonin in very small amounts may be helpful; most people attempt melatonin in much higher amounts and have adverse effects as a result. Melatonin affects the circadian rhythm cycle.  \n\nThe common prescribed sleep inducing drugs, such as Zolpidem or Zopiclone work on GABA A receptors. Phenibut works on GABA B. Pretty much anything involving the GABA system can get risky in terms of addiction and altering GABA regulation pretty fast, so be careful of these (most people would also state they are not nootropics). \n\nAntihistamines (like Benadryl) also have negatives such as tolerance and addiction, but work by affecting histamine in the brain; Histamines are associated with the state of wakefulness/alertness.\n\nNow, this is not really addressing your original question but I think it gets to the point that there are a lot of interdependencies in the sleep/wakefulness system that a) scientists are barely unraveling now and b) make finding a solution that doesn't upset the apple cart somewhere else very difficult.\n\nOther things you could look into: Valerian root, chamomille, passionflower, hops... \n","created_utc":"1428614650"}
{"body":"Hi, I'm the OP of the post you have quoted!\n\nAs to the question whether stimulants can or cannot cause sensitization, it's been proven that they can.\n\n[Rhesus monkeys that were given very low doses of Amphetamine showed an amplified response to a normal Amphetamine dose 5 days after the single dose, as well as 28 months (2.5 years) after the single dose, in comparison to the control group](http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v20/n1/full/1395233a.html).\n\nThis study has demonstrated that sensitization can occur from a single administration of a very low dose of Amphetamine, and this sensitization appears to be permanent (persisted for 2.5+ years). This is speculated to work like that since very low doses of Amphetamine inhibit monoamine release instead of enhancing it, so pre-synaptic dopaminergic receptors over-compensate for it by increasing both the amount of Dopamine being produced and the amount being released.\n\nSensitization to stimulants is a common phenomenon and can occur after just one very low dose. One low dose, that's all that is required to induce sensitization, as demonstrated in rhesus monkeys and rats.\n\nDrugs that act on GABAergic pathways show a similar mechanism. Ever wondered why drinking a little bit of Alcohol stimulates you, but drinking more puts you down? Alcohol acts as a stimulant in low doses and as a depressant in high doses. This is because low doses of Alcohol negatively modulate the sensitivity of GABA receptors, meaning GABA has less effects. Higher doses, though, positively modulate the sensitivity of GABA receptors, meaning GABA molecules have more effects. \n\nThat being said, it's not completely sure whether the GABA system can become sensitized like the dopamine system can. Dopaminergic neurons are very prone to sensitization for evolutionary reasons - when a new reward is learned, the dopamine system is nearly permanently sensitized. It's not sure whether the GABA system works in a similar way.\n\nAnd yes, taking 10mg of Adderall and experiencing symptoms of an overdose is a sign of sensitization to Adderall. I had become sensitized to Methylphenidate after taking 5mg one day and it's terrible. I personally found that it's very long lasting (it's been 8 months and I'm still sensitized) and the only solution is to avoid Methylphenidate, mainly because I'm not sure if it'll ever pass.\n\nIf you have any questions about the subject, I'll be more than glad to answer and discuss with you. I'm eager about studying this subject of sensitization and Hormesis in low doses, so if you have any experiences or questions about this to share I'll be happy to listen.","created_utc":"1437694573"}
{"body":"One thing that helped me a ton with the blowback from dosing phenibut is sulbutiamine and noopept. It's a great combination that works at full potency for about 3 days, which is generally enough time for the brain to readjust after such a world-rocking.\n\nBut if you already have a GABA problem in your head naturally, I'm sorry to say, but phenibut is risking major consequences for an effect that is offset with amplified side effects. The GABA system is responsible for keeping your brain from killing itself: this is why it is so rigidly regulated and why messing with it for any length of time will incite major countermeasures. Phenibut has the longest length of action of any GABAdic drug I know of, and that is the main thing that makes it so dangerous.\n\nHonestly, it would pay to try and make a *shorter-acting* form of phenibut, if a person could. I think Phenibut F.A.A. has a shorter action (it also can be absorbed sublingually due to the higher pH). You might want to look into F.A.A. if you really must continue with the phenibut.\n\nJust remember that things aren't always fair: I can't drink anymore because it makes me stupid, and with this in mind I only take phenibut once every month-and-a-half or so, because I don't trust myself to mess with GABA any more than that. It sounds like you have a sensitive system that isn't very balanced to begin with, and phenibut is anything but an attempt at balance. I think you would be happier in the long run severely limiting your use, perhaps to every two months, although I think you'd be happiest not messing with it at all.","created_utc":"1429788954"}
{"body":"OK, this subreddit seriously needs substance-specific FAQs for the most common substances (piracetam, modafinil and its variants, phenibut, ...)\n\nThese kinds of threads keep popping up. And the same thing happens every time. Some people proclaim it's a wonder drug, other people give ridiculously overcautious advice. Yes, this stuff is fucking great, yes, this stuff is fucking addictive, and yes, you can use it with regularity without getting addicted or sick or anything like that. But you have to do it right, by treating the drug with respect and following proper procedure. Here's how you do that:\n\n1. Find a trusted source. This is not a problem for phenibut, many vendors sell this stuff pure with a third-party CoA. You won't be getting bath salts when you order phenibut.\n2. Do an allergy test with a tiny dose. This is, assuming you followed rule #1, not really necessary with phenibut, since it is a very close analogue of an endogenous neurotransmitter and there are no reports of its being toxic or allergenic. You'd probably be dead if you were allergic to phenibut, as your GABA system would be unable to function if it couldn't handle such a close analogue.\n3. Do research and figure out the acceptable dosage range. Contrary to what other people here say, I would say the acceptable dosage range is 500-3000mg. For some, the lower end will be way too little, for others, the high end will be way too much. Higher-end doses are more recreational, lower-end doses more functional. Plan your day accordingly. Phenibut has no known toxic dose, so you can take much more without dying, but you will become ill or dependent or both, so just don't. But stay in this dosage range, and you'll be safe.\n4. Do more research and figure out how often you can take the stuff without becoming addicted, developing a tolerance, or doing damage to your brain. For phenibut, this is no more than one time per week, i.e., seven days between each use, preferably more. You could probably get away with six days, maybe even five, but seven is a cautious but not overcautious estimate.\n5. Titrate! Find the dose that works best *for you*. This means starting at the lower end of the dosage range and gauging the effects. If you are worried or unusually sensitive to similar drugs (alcohol, benzos, etc) start with 500 mg. If you think you can handle a bit more, you can start with 1000mg or even 1500mg. If you take too much, you will feel a bit ill but no worse than an alcohol hangover. If you are not satisfied with the effects, wait the required amount of time (about a week) and then up the dose by 500mg. By this point, your research should have indicated to you that it takes 3-4 hours to take full effect, so DO NOT redose until this much time has elapsed. Ideally, don't redose at all, just wait until tolerance resets and try a higher dose next time.\n6. Once you find a dose that gives you good effects and does not give you undesirable side effects, stick with it. Don't go higher. If you find yourself hitting 3+ grams and still aren't satisfied, or you find even lower doses have an unsatisfactory ratio of side effects to desirable effects, phenibut is not for you. Don't go higher.\n7. Be aware of duration and afterglow/hangover effects too. Lately I've been experiencing some uncomfortable sedation the next day from my usual dose, which is a sign I may be taking too much and need to dial it down. This can happen even if you've been fine taking the same dose for a long time.\n8. It goes without saying, but don't operate heavy machinery etc, until you know how the drug and dose affect you. Heavier doses can be a lot like being drunk, although generally the headspace is clearer and motor control is better.\n9. Once you have the dose, stick with your schedule, track your use somehow, and never fall for the temptation to break your schedule. Ever. Twice a week will turn into three times and then every day before you know it. I have zero problems staying w/ once-a-week usage, and do not experience any loss in potency or withdrawal effects from this regimen. But I don't trust myself with using more often. This stuff is very physically addictive, that much is true, but you *can* use it regularly as long as your frequency is appropriate.\n10. It *can* be combined with alcohol, but only if you follow these exact guidelines. I.e., start with very small doses of each and gauge the effects. Titrate up slowly. Do it in a safe environment. Don't do it often. It *will* potentiate the effects of alcohol. Personally I advice against it, but if you're going to do it, do it cautiously and responsibly.\n\nNotice a theme here? Be responsible! Exercise caution! Apply common sense and a quasi-scientific (quasi because it is too subjective to be called properly scientific) methodology. If you notice signs of addiction, step down your usage. If you notice uncomfortable side effects, step down your usage. That's all there is to it. You won't die, you won't turn into a zombie or a junkie if you follow these guidelines.","created_utc":"1370533137"}
{"body":"In my experience stimulant addiction is not a simple thing and I'm not sure how many people can even develop it. It's very different from opiate addiction that is very straightforward and simple. Sure we are dopamine seeking machines, but stimulants don't really provide dopamine rush equal to opiates and they have many side effects if abused for high. Also, stimulants don't activate endorphin reward system and thus it's impossible to get physically addicted like opiates, neither they do activate GABA system known to cause different kind of physical addiction. I have used MPH daily for months and then have taken break that lasted months with only symptoms of \"withdrawal\" being tiredness for few days after stopping. I also think chasing the high (whether it's stimulant or opiate, you're chasing dopamine in both cases and I'd argue stimulant addicts would be much better abusing opiates, safer that way even though just as stupid) is not symptom of using the drug. In my experience it's more quality of life and mental issue, usually triggered by depression. People who understand that getting high on life is much better than anything drugs can provide (way more dopamine in the long run) don't need to chase the high with stimulants, but can benefit from medical doses because it allows them to use their brain more efficiently and thus get high on life (not the drug) much better. \n\nI'm sorry MPH was such a bad drug for you, but we each have our own brain and effects are drugs can be very subjective. There are tons of people who greatly benefit from using MPH, even if it was drug from hell to you. Also wasn't it good thing that you ended up abusing MPH rather than amphetamines?

This is a fully unreasonable conclusion to infer, not only because that's not how things generally work, but because l-theanine etc. aren't even remotely mechanistically similar to benzodiazepines. l-theanine doesn't even interact with the GABA system directly; it's a glutamate modulator. Alcohol doesn't even drive cognitive decline unless consumed excessively, possibly because it [demonstrates genotoxic effects at high doses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23125219) among a bunch of other things. Alcohol's so damn complicated we have our own system dedicated to handling it.\n\nBy this rationale you could assume that caffeine is poison because it's a stimulant the same way cocaine is. That's nonsense. There's no such thing as a \"bad\" class of drugs. It's a false premise from the outset.","created_utc":"1506073212"}
{"body":"Which pharmaceuticals have you tried?\n\nI have life long anxiety, I stumbled across Mirtazapine, a lucky strike. It was the first anti depressant I ever took only 2 years ago, after suffering like a bitch (a figure of speech for effect) for 20 years+ with anxiety, the anxiety becoming ever more invasive and crippling. \n\nNow I don't believe in Serotonin model of depression. It's not about Serotonin or just Serotonin. Yes Mirtazapine does affect Serotonin receptors associated with anxiety, but it also affects 3a-HSD which is an enzyme which affects neuro steroid production in the brain, and to cut a long story short increase Allopregnanolone which in turn affects GABA system in the brain having a calming effect. \n\nLastly whilst we're here the French drug Etifoxine also affects neuro steroid production in the brain and GABA. It doesn't have significant liver problems associated with it. \n\nSo there's two drugs you may not have tried. Anxiety is not about taking a pill for a fix, but it's part of a plan to help your brain return to a state of much lesser anxiety. When you're very ill from being anxious then these drugs can be very useful. Also you need to be wise in choosing drugs that don't have a problem of making the anxiety worse, which can be attributed to benzodiazapine drugs for example. Fine as a short term solution, but if you're like me then anxiety doesn't do short term solutions. \n\nI must have taken over 200 supplements to try and treat anxiety. I've taken Zembrin as well. It's not on my list.\n\nHere's my best:\n\nBimuno Prebiotic\nA decent Probiotic containing L.Rhamnosus\nBacopa - Don't need this now, and currently don't take it\nL-Theanine sublingually when needed, maybe a couple times a week\nZinc Citrate 20mg 2-3 times a week\n\nMirtazapine for me has been better than any supplement, when I was badly ill, nothing was going to fix that anxiety except a pharmaceutical drug. For days where I start to lose my shit I make sure that I stick to taking what I've mentioned above. \n\nI strongly believe that modern life causes abnormal anxiety. I make sure every device I use filters out blue light. I make sure I practice relaxing and meditation. Anxiety is a pariah, a paranoid narcissist, it loves to hear about itself and reinforce its paranoia. You always have a choice whether to feed the anxiety or not, this may not seem true but I promise it's true.\n\nLastly I recommend reading the following books:\n\nMindfulness Finding Peace in a Frantic World\nThe Chimp Paradox by Dr Steve Peters\n\nThis is not a fool proof guide to anxiety. It's not a cure and looking for a cure just looks for a dead end which in effect reinforces the anxiety. You don't need a cure for anxiety, this is not the goal, the goal is to live a life with less intrusive anxiety. Believe it or not most people have anxiety often in their lives, but it's not a constant persistent menace. It doesn't have to be for you either. You may always be aware you're an anxious person but you can be in a place where you can cope with that. \n\n","created_utc":"1508279058"}
{"body":"&gt; Since i got my report I started eating clean and have lost 15 lbs.\n\nAt the very least that's a really good start and will probably be one of the biggest differences.\n\nIf you're after supplements than I'd say something to help out your GABA system like fasoracetam or emoxypine might be worth researching. One thing in particular would be to stay away from phenibut (which many people recommend for anxiety) if you've only recently quit drinking and are trying to get your baseline back to normal.","created_utc":"1507849803"}
{"body":"Phenibut has also a dopaminergic component in its effect (which explains your experience). So, instead of focusing on GABA system I think you could look into substances that repairs/boost *dopaminergic system*  : \nBPC-157 (I don't really know this substance but I often hear about it when people want to recover after amphetamine long-term use),  Bromantane (up-regulates tyrosine hydroxylase which produces dopamine), Uridine etc.","created_utc":"1496411935"}

{"body":"Phenibut seemed to sensitize my GABA system permanently and I ended up suffering severe withdrawals from any GABAergic, especially alcohol, in half the time it should have taken me to get there.

{"body":"So how exactly you can uppregulate GABA system using nACh system?","created_utc":"1496493901"}
{"body":"Fasoracetam is of course an experimental drug. The possible GABA upregulation effects are discussed in this old paper &gt;\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299997819255?via%3Dihub\n\nI think there's some confusion about Fasoracetam, in simplistic terms Caffeine (a generally anxiogenic drug) can upregulate GABA receptors so can exercise, these stresses on the body cause the brain to modulate the GABA receptor system to try and achieve balance. Fasoracetam possibly causes GABA upregulation by an indirect method, notice they mention repeated doses. Fasoracetam also modulates mGluR II/III activity in the brain. \n\nmGlu2/3 agonist, LY354740 (Eglumegad), was effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. So perhaps Fasoracetam takes time to modulate the mGluR system and this is the anxiolytic action and definitely this modulation could have an effect on the GABA system in the brain.\n\nIn the 1970's we didn't know about the mGlur system, I say system because there's modulating effects beyond the mGluR receptors. So here's a drug created in the 1970's which science didn't know how it worked\n\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenobam\n\nNotice its effects are on mGluR5 and because it has psychotomimetic effects it's possible it has direct or indirect action on NMDA receptors. We're only going to get better at treating anxiety, of course that should be obvious. But when you consider the complex interplay of biochemistry in the brain and the uniqueness to each person, and genetic expression, then it's a complex task all the same. People tend to think I need a drug that works on GABA or Serotonin which will relieve my anxiety, when the truth is far more complex. \n\nWhich is why I don't believe currently in the one pill fixes all treatment for anxiety. You can spend a long long long time trying to find a single compound that will always fix your anxiety, the brain doesn't work like that, it looks for balance. You can't possibly know if you have a chemical imbalance in the brain unless you caused it by consuming too much of a certain drug/supplement. GABAgenic compounds are a good example. So I'm fairly confident you won't find solice in Fasoracetam. Anxiety is a complex entity and it requires a multi modal approach to be really successful. So this is thought reframing via meditation/CBT, drug therapy where applicable, diet and exercise.  ","created_utc":"1496347876"}
